		<h2>Help</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; Feel free to ask the tutor questions if you need help on a open lab assignment.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>OLA Grading</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; Open lab assignments are graded on a 100 points scale.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Graded assignments are returned the next week. </li>
			<li>&#9733; The maximum grade you could get is <font color="red">60/100</font> if your source code has syntax
				errors.</li>
			<li>&#9733; It is a good idea to save graded assignments; if there is any disagreement about the recorded grades,
				you will need to show the graded assignment to document the mistake.</li>
