        <h2>Objective:</h2>
	In this assignment, you will strengthen your React development skills by building a dynamic personal blog application. 
	This project will deepen your understanding of React components, state management, event handling, React Router, and user input processing. 
	You will design an interactive interface that allows users to create, view, and delete blog posts, navigate between pages, 
	and dynamically manage content. Through this hands-on experience, you will gain proficiency in structuring a 
	multi-page React application while applying best practices in component reusability and state management.
	
	<h2>Step 1: React Component Development (50 Points)</h2>


	(1) &clubs; Create React components for different pages (Home.js, Blog.js, NewPost.js, PostDetail.js).<br>
	(2) &clubs; Implement state management (useState) for handling blog posts dynamically.<br>
	(3) &clubs; Ensure each component is well-structured and functional.<br>

	<br>
	    
    	<h2>Step 2: Implementing React Router (20 Points)</h2>

	(1) &clubs; Install and configure React Router for multi-page navigation.<br>
	(2) &clubs; Use the &lt;Link&gt; component for navigation. <br>
	(3) &clubs; Handle 404 (Not Found) pages correctly. <br>

	<h2>Step 3: Form Handling & Event Management (15 Points)</h2>

	(1) Implement a form in NewPost.js to allow users to add blog posts. <br>
	(2) Use controlled components (useState) for form input management. <br>
	(3) Ensure form validation (e.g., title, author, and content fields cannot be empty). <br>
	(4) After submission, update the blog post list dynamically. <br>

	<h2>Step 4: Post Viewing & Deletion (10 Points)</h2>
	
	(1) Create PostDetail.js to display full blog post details.<br>
	(2) Implement Delete functionality to remove posts from the list. <br>
	(3) Use React state updates to dynamically reflect deletions. <br>

	<h2>Step 5: Styling & UI Enhancement (5 Points)</h2>

	(1) Apply CSS to enhance the appearance of the blog. <br>
	(2) Style navigation links, form inputs, buttons, and blog post lists. <br>
	(3) Ensure a responsive layout for better user experience. <br>
	    
        <h2>Step 6: Submission Instructions</h2>
        
        Please compress your folder my-react-blog into a single ZIP archive and submit it through D2L.
