        structure and CSS styling.

        <h2>Step 1: Create a CV Webpage in HTML/CSS</h2>

        <h3>1. Title</h3>
        Set an appropriate title for your CV, such as "John Doe's CV".

        <h3>2. Education Background</h3>
        Present your educational background using a list, table, or any other HTML structure you prefer. Include details
        like high school, bachelor's degree, and master's degree.

        <h3>3. Skills</h3>
        Display your skills, such as programming languages or software tools you are proficient in, using a list, table,
        or any other HTML structure you prefer.

        <h3>4. Work Experience</h3>
        Outline your work experience using a list, table, or any other HTML structure you prefer. If you do not have any
        work experience, you may skip this section.

        <h3>5. Research/Scholarly Activity</h3>
        Detail your research or scholarly activities using a list, table, or any other HTML structure you prefer. If you
        do not have any research or scholarly activities, you may skip this section.

        <h3>6. Awards</h3>
        List any awards you have received using a list, table, or any other HTML structure you prefer. If you do not have
        any awards, you may skip this section.

        <h3>7. Bookmark</h3>
        Include a bookmark link that allows users to quickly navigate back to the top of your webpage.

        <h3>8. Formatting</h3>
        Apply formatting to highlight important information in your CV.

        <h3>9. Comments</h3>
        Add necessary comments to your HTML code to explain different sections or components.

        <h3>10. CSS Styling</h3>
        Enhance the appearance of your CV by adding CSS styles. You can customize colors, backgrounds, font styles, and
        more to create a visually appealing design.

        <h2>Step 2: Add CSS Styling to Your OLA 1</h2>
        Revisit your OLA 1 personal webpage and apply CSS styling to improve its design. Consider adjusting colors,
        backgrounds, font styles, and other stylistic elements to enhance its visual appeal.

        <h2>Step 3: Create a Navigation Bar</h2>
        Develop a navigation bar that allows users to switch between your Home page (OLA 1 personal webpage) and your CV
        page. Ensure that the navigation bar is present on both pages for seamless navigation.

        <h2>Submission:</h2>
        
        Please submit all files in D2L. Please compress all files as an zip file, and submit 
        the zip file in D2L.

        <h2>Grading:</h2>
