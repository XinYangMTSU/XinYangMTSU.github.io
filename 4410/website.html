		<h1>How does the Website Work?</h1>

		<h2>The World Wide Web</h2>

		When most of us talk about using the "Internet", we're typically talking about a specific part of the Internet: the
		<b>
			<font color="red">World Wide Web</font>
		</b> (WWW, or simply, the Web). The Web is a massive network of webpages, programs, and files that are accessible
		via URLs.
		A <b>URL</b> (Uniform Resource Locator) is a unique identifier used to locate a resource on the Internet. It is also
		referred to as a web address. URLs consist of multiple parts -- including a protocol and domain name -- that tell a
		web browser how and where to retrieve a resource.<br><br>
		We call it a web because of its vast interconnectedness. Starting from one URL, such as http://wikipedia.org, we can
		follow links to eventually reach millions of webpages from across the globe.

		A web browser loads a webpage using various protocols:

		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; It uses the <b>
					<font color="red">Domain Name System</font>
				</b> (DNS) protocol to convert a domain name into an IP address.</li>
			<li>&#9733; It uses the <b>
					<font color="red">HyperText Transfer Protocol</font>
				</b> (HTTP) to request the webpage contents from that IP address.</li>
			<li>&#9733; It may also use the <b>
					<font color="red">Transport Layer Security</font>
				</b> (TLS) protocol(Opens in a new window) to serve the website over a secure, encrypted connection.</li>
		</ul>

		The web browser uses these protocols on top of the Internet protocols, so every HTTP request also uses TCP and IP.

		<h3>
			Domain Name System (DNS)
		</h3>
		<hr>
		As we just learned, IP addresses are how computers identify other computers on the Internet. IP addresses aren't
		particularly human-friendly, though. Who wants to memorize an address like 74.125.20.113? Or the even harder IP v6
		addresses? The <b>domain name system</b> gives us humans an easy way to identify where we want to go on the
		Internet. We simply type in a domain name like "www.wikipedia.org", and our computer connects us to the computers
		powering Wikipedia:<br><br>

		</center>
		<br>
		A domain name is a human-friendly address for a website, something that's easy for us to remember and type in.
		<br>
		<h3>
			Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
		</h3>
		<hr>
		Whenever you visit a page on the web, your computer uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to download that
		page from another computer somewhere on the Internet.
		<br>
		Let's step through that process. <br>

		<h3>Step 1: Direct browser to URL</h3>
		The user types a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) in the browser:
		<br>
		<center>
			<img src="wikipedia.png" height="140px" width="600px">
		</center>
		<br>
		<h3>Step 2: Browser looks up IP</h3>
		We typically type nice human-friendly URLs into browsers, like "khanacademy.org" and "wikipedia.org". Those domain
		names map to IP addresses, the true location of the domain's computers. That's handled by the Domain Name System.
		The browser uses a DNS resolver to map the domain to an IP address:
		<br>
		<br>
		<center>

		</center>
		<br>
		<h3>Step 3: Browser sends HTTP request</h3>
		Once the browser identifies the IP address of the computer hosting the requested URL, it sends an HTTP request.
		<br>
		<br>
		<center>
			<img src="http1.png" width="500px" height="200px">
		</center>
		<br>

		<h3>Step 4: Host sends back HTTP response</h3>
		Once the host computer receives the HTTP request, it sends back a response with both the content and metadata about
		it.
		<br>
		<h3>Step 5: The browser renders the response</h3>
		The browser now has all the information it needs to render the document requested.

		<h2>Web Client,Server Architecture</h2>

		<br><br>


		<h3>Web Browser</h3>
		The purpose of a web browser(Chrome, IE, Firefox, Safari) is to requests and interprets web pages encoded with HTML,
		CSS, JavaScript, etc. The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the
		document.

		<h3>Web Server</h3>
		Web server holds web pages and processes browser requests.

		<h3>Web Site</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>&#9734; Static Websites</li>
			The users can read and watch them but cannot interact with the content in any way.
			<br><br>
			<li>&#9734; Dynamic Websites</li>
			These websites keep updatin content based on the user input.
		</ul>

		<h3>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h3>
		HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and
		JavaScript. HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless the complexity of a site or number of technologies
		involved. It's an essential skill for any web professional. It's the starting point for anyone learning how to
		create content for the web.
		<br>

		<h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h3>
		CSS is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout. This programming language dictates how the HTML
		elements of a website should actually appear on the frontend of the page. HTML provides the raw tools needed to
		structure content on a website. CSS, on the other hand, helps to style this content so it appears to the user the
		way it was intended to be seen. These languages are kept separate to ensure websites are built correctly before
		they're reformatted.
		<br>

		<h3>JavaScript</h3>
		JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements. JavaScript is a more complicated language than
		HTML or CSS, and it wasn't released in beta form until 1995. Nowadays, JavaScript is supported by all modern web
		browsers and is used on almost every site on the web for more powerful and complex functionality. JavaScript is a
		programming language that lets web developers design interactive sites. Most of the dynamic behavior you'll see on a
		web page is thanks to JavaScript.

		<h2>Process for developing a website</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>&#9734; Plan and design the website</li>
			<li>&#9734; Create the web pages using an editor</li>
			<li>&#9734; Test the web pages</li>
			<li>&#9734; Publish the web pages by uploading the pages to the web server.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Exercise</h2>

		<h3>1.</h3>Ororo types this URL in her browser's address bar:
		https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/
		<br>
		After a few seconds, the browser loads the webpage.
		Which of these protocols are used by the browser in fetching and loading webpage?

		<ul>
			<li>a. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</li>
			<li>b. POP (Post Office Protocol)</li>
			<li>c. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</li>
			<li>d. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</li>
			<li>e. IP (Internet Protocol)</li>
			<li>f. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h3>2.</h3>When we browse websites on the World Wide Web, we're relying on browsers and servers communicating
		together across wide distances.
		<br>
		Which of these best describe the role of the browser and server?

		<ul>
			<li>a. The browser is responsible for sending HTTP requests to the server that hosts the website. The server is
				responsible for sending HTTP responses that contain the code of websites.</li>
			<li>b. The browser is responsible for browsing through its files to find the code for each website. The server is
				responsible for figuring out the optimal path of routers for a webpage request to reach the server.</li>
			<li>c. The browser is responsible for finding interesting webpages for the user. The server is responsible for
				serving users with warnings for visiting insecure websites.</li>
			<li>d. The server is responsible for sending HTTP requests to the browser that hosts the website. The browser is
				responsible for sending HTTP responses that contain the code of websites.</li>
		</ul>
