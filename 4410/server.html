		<h1>Web Servers</h1>

		A <b><font color="blue">Web Server</font></b> is a <b><font color="blue">computer or software</font></b> that stores, 
		processes, and delivers web pages to users via the <b><font color="blue">Internet</font></b>.

		<h2>Overview</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; Web server is a computer where the web content is stored.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Basically a web server is used to host the web sites, but there exist other web servers also, such as
				gaming, storage, FTP, email etc.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Web site is a collection of web pages while web server is a software that responds to the request for web
				resources.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Common Uses of Web Servers</h2>

		<ul>
			<li><b><font color="blue">Hosting websites</font></b> (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, etc.).</li>
			<li><b><font color="blue">Handling client requests</font></b> via the HTTP protocol.</li>
			<Li><b><font color="blue">Serving files</font></b> (images, videos, downloads).</Li>
			<Li><b><font color="blue">Running web applications</font></b> (dynamic content, user logins, etc.).</Li>
			<li><b><font color="blue">Acting as an API server</font></b> for mobile and desktop applications.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Web Server Working</h2>


		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; Web server respond to the client request in either of the following two ways:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>&star; Sending the file to the client associated with the requested URL.</li>
				<li>&star; Generating response by invoking a script and communicating with database.</li>
				<img src="server1.jpeg">
			</ul>
		</ul>

		<!--

		<h3>Key Points</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; When client sends request for a web page, the web server search for the requested page if requested
				page is found then it will send it to client with an HTTP response.</li>
			<li>&#9733; If the requested web page is not found, web server will the send an HTTP response:Error 404 Not found.
			</li>
			<li>&#9733; If client has requested for some other resources then the web server will contact to the application
				server and data store to construct the HTTP response.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>Architecture</h2>
		Web Server Architecture follows the following two approaches:
		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; Concurrent Approach</li>
			<li>&#9733; Single-Process-Event-Driven Approach.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Concurrent Approach</h3>
		Concurrent approach allows the web server to handle multiple client requests at the same time. It can be achieved by
		following methods:
		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; Multi-process</li>
			<ul>
				<li>&star; In this a single process (parent process) initiates several single-threaded child processes and
					distribute incoming requests to these child processes. Each of the child processes are responsible for
					handling single request.</li>
				<li>&star; It is the responsibility of parent process to monitor the load and decide if processes should be
					killed or forked.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>&#9733; Multi-threaded</li>
			<ul>
				<li>&star; Unlike Multi-process, it creates multiple single-threaded process.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>&#9733; Hybrid method</li>
			<ul>
				<li>&star; It is combination of above two approaches. In this approach multiple process are created and each
					process initiates multiple threads. Each of the threads handles one connection. Using multiple threads in
					single process results in less load on system resources.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		-->
		
		Web servers process files written in different programming languages:
		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; PHP</li>
			<li>&#9733; Python</li>
			<li>&#9733; Java</li>
			<li>&#9733; and others.</li>
		</ul>

		<!--
		<h3>Single Process Event Driven</h3>

		The SPED model uses a single process to perform all client processing and disk activity in an event-driven manner.

		<h2>Popular Web Servers</h2>

		<table style="width: 70%;">
			<tr>
				<th>Server</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Apache HTTP Server</th>
				<td>This is the most popular web server in the world developed by the Apache Software Foundation. Apache web
					server is an open source software and can be installed on almost all operating systems including Linux, UNIX,
					Windows, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and more. About 60% of the web server machines run the Apache Web Server.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>NGINX</th>
				<td>Nginx was created to solve the so-called c10k problem, meaning that a web server that uses threads to handle
					user requests is unable to manage more than 10,000 connections at the same time.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Internet Information Services (IIS)</th>
				<td>The Internet Information Server (IIS) is a high performance Web Server from Microsoft. This web server runs
					on Windows NT/2000 and 2003 platforms (and may be on upcoming new Windows version also). IIS comes bundled
					with Windows NT/2000 and 2003; Because IIS is tightly integrated with the operating system so it is relatively
					easy to administer it.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Lighttpd</th>
				<td>The lighttpd, pronounced lighty is also a free web server that is distributed with the FreeBSD operating
					system. This open source web server is fast, secure and consumes much less CPU power. Lighttpd can also run on
					Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris operating systems.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Sun Java System Web Server</th>
				<td>This web server from Sun Microsystems is suited for medium and large web sites. Though the server is free it
					is not open source. It however, runs on Windows, Linux and UNIX platforms. The Sun Java System web server
					supports various languages, scripts and technologies required for Web 2.0 such as JSP, Java Servlets, PHP,
					Perl, Python, and Ruby on Rails, ASP and Coldfusion etc.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Jigsaw Server</th>
				<td>Jigsaw (W3C's Server) comes from the World Wide Web Consortium. It is open source and free and can run on
					various platforms like Linux, UNIX, Windows, and Mac OS X Free BSD etc. Jigsaw has been written in Java and
					can run CGI scripts and PHP programs.</td>

		<h2>Apache HTTP Server</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; Apache is an open-source and free web server software.</li>
			<li>&#9733; It powers around 46% of websites around the world.</li>
			<li>&#9733; It’s maintained and developed by the Apache Software Foundation.</li>
			<li>&#9733; The first version was released in 1995.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How Does Apache Web Server Work?</h3>


		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; Apache Web Server is not a physical server, but rather a software that runs on a server.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Its job is to establish a connection between a server and the browsers of website visitors (Firefox,
				Google Chrome, Safari, etc.) while delivering files back and forth between them (client-server structure).</li>
			<li>&#9733; Apache is a cross-platform software, therefore it works on both Unix and Windows servers.</li>
		</ul>

		When a visitor wants to load a page on your website:

		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; Their browser sends a request to your server.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Apache returns a response with all the requested files (text, images, etc.).</li>
			<li>&#9733; The server and the client communicate through the HTTP protocol.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Apache is responsible for the smooth and secure communication between the two machines.</li>
		</ul>

		Apache is highly customizable, as it has a module-based structure:


		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; Modules allow server administrators to turn additional functionalities on and off.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Apache has modules for security, caching, URL rewriting, password authentication, and more.</li>
			<li>&#9733; You can also set up your own server configurations through a file called .htaccess, which is an Apache
				configuration file supported with all Hostinger plans.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>Apache vs NGINX</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; Since Apache uses the thread-based structure, owners of traffic-heavy websites may encounter
				performance problems. Nginx is one of the web servers that address the c10k problem and probably the most
				successful one.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Nginx has an event-driven architecture that doesn’t create a new process for each request. Instead, it
				handles every incoming request in a single thread. This master process manages several worker processes that
				perform the actual processing of requests. The event-based model of Nginx distributes user requests among worker
				processes in an efficient way, therefore leading to much better scalability.</li>
			<li>&#9733; If you need to manage a high-traffic website Nginx is an excellent choice, as it can do that by using
				minimal resources. It cannot be a coincidence that it’s used by many high-visibility websites such as Netflix,
				Hulu, Pinterest, and Airbnb.</li>
			<li>&#9733; However, for small and medium players, Apache comes with a handful of advantages over Nginx, such as
				its easy configuration, lots of modules, and a beginner-friendly environment.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>Apache Pros and Cons</h2>

		<h3>Pros:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; Open-source and free, even for commercial use.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Reliable, stable software.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Frequently updated, regular security patches.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Flexible due to its module-based structure.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Easy to configure, beginner-friendly.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Cross-platform (works on both Unix and Windows servers).</li>
			<li>&#9733; Works out of the box with WordPress sites.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Huge community and easily available support in case of any problem.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Cons:</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; Performance problems on extremely traffic-heavy websites.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Too many configuration options can lead to security vulnerabilities.
			</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>Setting Up a Web Server Using XAMPP</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html" target="_blank">XAMPP</a> is the most popular PHP
				development environment.</li>
			<li>&#9733; <b>
					<font color="blue">XAMPP = Apache + MariaDB + PHP + Perl</font>
				</b></li>
		</ul>

		<h3>MariaDB vs MySQL</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; MariaDB was forked from MySQL source code around version 5.5, circa 2010. Programmers at Monty Program
				implemented some new features, or integrated features developed by other contributors, or back-ported some
				features from MySQL 5.6 or 5.7.</li>
			<li>&#9733; MariaDB is mostly based on the same source code as MySQL.</li>
			<li>&#9733; MariaDB reads and writes the same database files as MySQL. MariaDB supports the same flavor of SQL
				query language, with a few enhancements created by MariaDB. They mostly follow the same internal architecture as
				MySQL, again with some minor improvements developed for MariaDB. In general, you could use MariaDB as a drop-in
				replacement for MySQL software without changing your queries or your data files.</li>
			<li>&#9733; However, as time goes on, MySQL develops more extensive features or changes to its internal
				architecture. They have more developers on staff than MariaDB, so they are making changes at a faster pace.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Gradually, MySQL and MariaDB will diverge.</li>
		</ul>

		</ul>

		<br>


		<h2>What if you cannot start MySQL server?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; XAMPP will use port 3306 for MySQL server. If the default port 3306 has been occupied by another
				process, then you
				cannot start the MySQL server.</li>
			<li>&#9733; You can use the following command to check if port 3306 be occupied:</li>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>netstat -vanp tcp | grep 3306</b>
			<li>&#9733; If the port 3306 has been occupied, usually it has been used by another mysql process, you can use the
				following command to kill it:</li>
			&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>sudo pkill mysql</b>
			<li>&#9733; or You can change the port 3306 to another port number such as 3307, 3308 in the file:
				<ul>
					<li>&star; "properties.ini" (for Mac Users)</li>
					<li>&star; "my.ini" (for Windows Users)</li>
					<li>&star; And add the following line to 'config.inc.php' (replace '3307 with whatever port your MySQL is
						running
						on):
						<pre>
					$cfg['Servers'][$i]['port'] = '3307';
						</pre>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
