		<h1>How does the Internet Work?</h1>

		<h2>Internet</h2>

		The <b>Internet</b> is the collection of computers that can communicate with one another using <b>
			<font color="red">TCP/IP</font>
		</b> over an open,
		global
		communications network. The Internet is the world's largest computer network. Whenever computing devices are
		connected together in a network, they need protocols to communicate with each other.
		If the devices want to communicate over the Internet, they must use Internet networking protocols.

		<br><br>
		Millions of computers around the world are connected by cables, fiber, and wireless links. We use the Internet to
		read blogs, watch videos, send emails, and download pictures and music. But how does the Internet work?


		<h2>TCP/IP</h2>

		A computer <b>
			<font color="blue">communication protocol</font>
		</b> is a detailed specification of how communication between two computers will be carried out in order to serve
		some purpose. Communications between computers on a network is done through protocol. <b> <br> <br>
			<font color="red">TCP/IP</font> (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
		</b> is the fundamental communication protocol for the Internet. 
		TCP/IP is a set of communication protocols used to connect devices on the internet and local networks. 
		It defines how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. 
		TCP handles error-checking and data integrity, while IP manages addressing and routing.
		<br><br>
		TCP/IP is normally considered to be a 4-layer
		system. The 4 layers are as follows:
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				&#9733; Application layer
			</li>
			<li>&#9733; Transport layer</li>
			<li>&#9733; Network layer</li>
			<li>&#9733; Data link layer</li>
		</ul>

		<center>
			<img src="layer.png" width="800px" heigh="1000px">
		</center>

		<h3>1. Application layer</h3>
		<hr>
		The application layer is the topmost layer of the TCP/IP protocol suite. 
		The Application layer is responsible for enabling communication between users and network services.
		It provides an interface for applications to send and receive data over the network. 
		The application layer uses different protocols to complete the requests for different programs. 
		Some of the protocols used by the application layer include :
		<ol>
			<li><b>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</b>: Used for web browsing</li>
			<li><b>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</b>: For transferring files between computers</li>
			<li><b>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</b>: For sending emails</li>
			<li><b>Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)</b>: For secure file transfers over SSH</li>
		</ol>
		For example, when we request our browser to access a web server, it calls HTTP protocol to complete the request.
		Similarly, when we want to upload (or download) a file through a program, the application layer uses the FTP
		protocol to complete the request.
		The application layer uses the ports to pass on the data to the transport layer.
		The ports are logical addresses/interfaces that connect a computer to internal or external devices. The use of the
		ports make it easier for the transport layer to understand the type of data. For example, data sent over port 25 is typically related to 
		email communication via the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). Data sent over port 21 is used for standard FTP (File Transfer Protocol) 
		transfers, while port 22 is associated with secure communications using SSH (Secure Shell) and SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).

		<h3>2. Transport layer</h3>
		<hr>
		The application layer sends the data to the lower layer, i.e. the transport layer. The transport layer converts the
		data into data packets and sends to the destination device. The transport layer uses the <b><font color="blue">Transmission Control Protocol
		(TCP)</font></b> and the <b><font color="blue">User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</font></b>. 
		<br><br>
		TCP is the data transport protocol
		that's most commonly used on top of IP and it
		includes strategies for packet ordering, retransmission, and data integrity, which ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
		TCP is best used for direct communication in which a reliable connection is needed, 
		such as web browsing, email, text messaging, and file transfers. 
		<br><br>
		
		UDP is an alternative protocol that solves fewer problems but offers faster data transport, which provides faster, connectionless communication without reliability guarantees.
		UDP is best used for live and real-time data transmission when speed is more important than 
		reliability, such as live streaming, online gaming, and voice-over-IP (VoIP). 
		<br><br>
		When the transport layer receives data from the application layer, it is transformed
		into the <b>
			<font color="blue">data packets</font>
		</b>:
		Everything transmissed on the Internet involves packets. For example, every Web page that you receive comes as a
		series
		of packets, and every e-mail you send leaves as a series of packets. Networks that ship data around in small packets
		are called <b>
			<font color="blue">packet switched networks</font>
		</b>.

		<center>
			<img src="packetSwitching.png" height="500px" width="800px">
		</center>

		<br><br>

		The TCP and UDP add a header to the data packets. The TCP header contains different fields
		like source and destination port information; packet sequence number, acknowledgment information, and checksum
		values. Each field plays its role when data packets are exchanged. For example, the checksum field is used to check
		if any packet during the data exchange process has been tampered or not. The sequence number tells the TCP at the
		destination about the order of the packet. The TCP at the receiver end combines the packets in the correct order
		with the help of the sequence numbers. When a packet is successfully transferred, the devices acknowledge the
		successful delivery of the packets. If the sender does not receive an acknowledgment by the receiver in a specified
		period of time or window, it resends the packet. The entire packets at the receiver end are arranged into the correct
		order; the headers are removed from the packets before reassembling them into a complete message.

		<h3>3. Network Layer</h3>
		<hr>
		This layer is also known as the Internet layer.
		The Network Layer is responsible for routing data packets across different networks to their destination. 
		It handles logical addressing using IP addresses and ensures data can travel from the source to the target device, 
		even across multiple networks. 
		<br><br>
		The data packets from the transport layer travel down to the network layer. Different protocols operate at the
		network layer including Internet Protocol (IP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), and Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).
		<br><br>
		ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is a network layer protocol used for error reporting and diagnostic functions in an IP network.
		It helps devices communicate issues such as unreachable destinations, packet loss, and congestion. Unlike TCP or UDP, ICMP is not used for data transmission but for network troubleshooting and control. 
		It is crucial for network health monitoring and issue resolution. 
		<br><br>
		ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) operates at the network layer to map an IP address to a corresponding MAC (Media Access Control) address. 
		When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same local network, it needs the recipient's MAC address. 
		ARP helps by sending a broadcast request to all devices, asking "Who has this IP?" The device with the matching IP responds with its MAC address. 
		This process ensures data is sent to the correct physical hardware address within a local network.
		<br><br>
		At the network layer, a header called IP header is added to the data packet. The IP header contains
		the source and destination IP address. The packet is sent out to the destination via a router. The router contains a
		table containing IP addresses of different hosts including the gateway devices (other routers). The router checks if
		the destination IP address matches with the IP address saved in the table. If the router fails to locate the
		destination IP address, it sends the data packets to the other router device. The process continues until the packet
		reaches the destination.
		<br> <br>
		The packet will be transferred along with the source and destination IP addresses and some other header information,
		such as the length of the data. If the destination computer is on the same local network as the source, then the
		packet will be directly sent to the destination via this network. If the destination is on another network, the
		packet will be sent to a gateway, which is a device that is connected to the source computer’s network as well as to
		at least one other network. The gateway will select a computer on one of the other networks to which it is attached
		and send the packet onto that computer. This process will continue, with the packet going through perhaps a dozen
		or more hops, until the packet reaches the destination computer.

		There are two versions of the Internet Protocol in use today, 
		which is responsible for identifying and locating devices on a network.

		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; <b>
					<font color="blue">IPv4</font> (Internet Protocol version 4)
				</b>, the first version ever used on the Internet</li>
			<li>&#9733; <b>
					<font color="blue">IPv6</font> (Internet Protocol version 6)
				</b>, a backwards-compatible successor</li>
		</ul>

		 

		IPv4 addresses are <B><font color="blue">32-bit</font></B> numbers that are typically displayed in dotted decimal notation.<br>
		In the <b>
			<font color="red">IPv4</font>
		</b> protocol, IP addresses look like this:
		<b>
			<font color="blue">74.125.20.113</font>
		</b> <br>
		Each IP address is split into 4 numbers, and each of those numbers can range from 0 to 255:
		<b>
			<font color="blue">[0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255]</font>
		</b><br>
		We write those numbers in <B><font color="blue">decimal</font></B>, but the computer stores them in binary, like so:
		<font color="blue">01010101 01010101 01010101 01010101
		</font><br>
		Each number can represent 2<sup>8</sup> values, Overall, that's 2<sup>32</sup> possible values:
		4,294,967,296 (~4.3 billion) possible IPv4 addresses.
		<br>
		<br>
		When it became obvious in the 1990s
		that the IPv4 addresses were running out, the IPv6 protocol was proposed with a much longer addressing scheme.<br>
		Here's an <b>
			<font color="red">IPv6</font>
		</b> address: <font color="blue">2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</font>
		<br>Notice the letters in those numbers, like d and b? Those are <B><font color="blue">hexadecimal</font></B> numbers, hexadecimal is a numbering
		system with base 16 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F).<br>
		There are 8 hexadecimal numbers in IPv6 address, and each number is 4 digits long. The highest value for each
		number is FFFF, since F is the highest
		digit in hexadecimal. <br>
		Thus, the highest address would look like:
		<font color="blue">FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF</font>
		<br>
		In total, each IPv6 address is represented by <B><font color="blue">128-bit</font></B>, so there are 2<sup>128</sup> possible IPv6 addresses. <br>
		That's 340340340 undecillion:
		340,282,366,920,938,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (virtually unlimited)
		<br>
		<br>
		<h4>
			<font color="blue">IPv4 address hierarchy:</font>
		</h4>
		Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are hierarchical. For simplicity, let's examine the hierarchy of IP v4 addresses. <br>
		Consider this IP address: 24.147.242.217
		<br>
		That IP address could be broken down into these 2 parts:
		<br>

		<img src="subnet.png" height="100px" width="400px">
		<br>
		The first two octets (16 bits) identifies a network administered by the Comcast (an Internet Service Provider).
		The last two octets (the final 16 bits) identifies a home computer on that Comcast network.
		<br>
		<img src="subnet2.png" height="400px" width="800px">
		<br>
		If the last two octets were different, then the IP address would point at a different computer on the Comcast
		network. If the first two octets were different, then the IP address might belong to a completely different network
		administrator. The Internet Protocol uses this hierarchical addressing scheme to make it easier to route messages
		from source to destination. Once a message arrives at the network, a network router can take care of sending it to
		the individual node.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>
			<font color="red">Question:</font>
		</b>What's your IP address? <br>

		<h3>4. Data Link Layer</h3>
		<hr>
		The Data Link Layer is responsible for enabling reliable communication between devices on the same physical network. 
		It handles framing, addressing (using MAC addresses), error detection, and access control to ensure data is delivered correctly across the local network.
		The data link layer is subdivided into three layers:
		<ol>
			<li>Logic Link Control (LLC)</li>
			<li>Media Access Control (MAC) Layer</li>
			<li>Physical Layer</li>
		</ol>

		The LLC has the information about the protocol used by the network layer. The
		LLC, at the receiving end, helps in deciding the delivery of the data packet to the corresponding protocol at the
		destination network layer. <br>
		The MAC layer adds the source and destination MAC address to the data frames. <br>
		The
		physical layer converts the data frames into a format that can be transmitted over the network. For instance, the
		physical layer converts the data frames into electrical signals if the path is wired. Similarly, the data frames
		are
		converted into electromagnetic waves for wireless communication medium. The aforementioned layers work conversely
		at
		the receiving end. The electric signals or electromagnetic waves are converted back into data frames, the headers
		are removed from the packets; finally, the packets are reassembled into complete data.
		<br>

		<h4>
			<font color="blue">Physical network connections:</font>
		</h4>
		The Internet is a network of computers connected to each other. But what does each physical connection look like? It
		depends on the needs of the connection and the size of the network.
		<ul>
			<li><b>
					<font color="red">Copper cables</font>
				</b></li>
			If you're in a computer lab or near a modem, you can probably find a cable similar to this one:
			<br>
			<img src="cable.jpeg" width="250px" height="150px">
			<br>
			This is a type of twisted pair cable, twisted pair cables send data through a network by transmitting pulses of
			electricity that represent binary data: <br>
			<img src="twistedCable.png" width="500px" height="150px">
			<br>
			To make sure cables are transmitting information in a way that can be understood by the recipient, they follow the
			Ethernet standards. That's why twisted pair cables are commonly known as <b>Ethernet cables</b>.
			They are used both in networks as small as a company office (a LAN) or as large as an entire country (a WAN).
			<br>
			<br>

			<li><b>
					<font color="red">Fiber-optic cables</font>
				</b></li>
			A fiber-optic cable contains an optical fiber that can carry light (instead of electricity). The fiber is coated
			with plastic layers and sheathed in a protective tube to protect it from the environment.<br>
			<img src="fiber.jpeg" width="400px" height="250px">
			<br><br>
			Fiber-optic cables communicate by sending pulses of light that represent binary data:<br><br>
			<img src="fiberPulse.png" width="500px" height="150px">
			<br>
			They typically also follow the Ethernet standards to make sure they're sending data in a way that can be commonly
			understood by any recipient in the network.
			Fiber-optic cables are capable of transmitting much more data per second than copper cables. They're often used to
			connect networks across oceans so that data can travel quickly around the world. As fiber-optic cables become less
			expensive, they're becoming increasingly common in city-wide networks as well.
			<br>
			<br>
			<li><b>
					<font color="red">Wireless</font>
				</b></li>
			Wireless connections don't involve any wiring. A wireless card inside the computer turns binary data into radio
			waves and transmits them through the air:
			<br>
			<img src="wireless.png" width="500px" height="150px">
			<br>
			Those radio waves can't travel very far: 75-100 feet in a place like an office building that's filled with all
			sorts of obstacles, or up to 1000 feet in a wide open field.
			The waves are hopefully picked up by a wireless access point which converts them from radio waves back into binary
			data. Wireless access points are connected to the rest of the network using physical wiring, like copper or
			fiber-optic cables. Wireless connections are limited in how much area they can cover, but they are increasingly
			commonplace due to the prevalent use of portable computing devices.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			At any given time, our Internet connection might be using a combination of those technologies. Maybe we're using
			WiFi to connect to our home router, our home router is using twisted pair copper cables to connect to the
			metropolitan network, and those cables are hopping over fiber to communicate with overseas data centers. Each
			technology has both advantages and disadvantages:

			<br>
			<img src="connection.png" width="800px" height="300px">
			<br>
		</ul>

		<h4>
			<font color="blue">Bit rate:</font>
		</h4>
		All of the computing devices on the Internet are communicating in binary. Whether they are connected via wired or
		wireless, they are sending electromagnetic signals that represent streams of 1s and 0s. Network connections can send
		bits very fast. We measure that speed using the <b>bit rate</b>, the number of bits of data that are sent each
		second. <br>
		The earliest Internet connections were just 75 bps (bits per second). These days, connections are more often
		measured in Mbps (megabits per second).
		<br><br>

		<table style="width:50%">
			<tr>
				<th>Unit</th>
				<th>Number of bits</th>
				<th></th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>kilobit</td>
				<td>1000</td>
				<th>1 thousand</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>megabit</td>
				<td>1000<sup>2</sup></td>
				<th>1 Million</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>gigabit</td>
				<td>1000<sup>3</sup></td>
				<th>1 Billion</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>terabit</td>
				<td>1000<sup>4</sup></td>
				<th>1 Trillion</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>petabit</td>
				<td>1000<sup>5</sup></td>
				<th>1 Quadrillion</th>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<h4>
			<font color="blue">Bandwidth</font>
		</h4>
		We use the term bandwidth to describe the maximum bit rate of a system. If a network connection has a bandwidth of
		100 Mbps, which means it can't transfer more than 100 megabits per second.
		Ever heard the term "broadband Internet"? That refers to a connection with a minimum bandwidth that requires a minimum of 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload speeds. 
		That's enough bandwidth for basic Internet use like checking emails, reading websites, streaming, and video calls.
		<br>

		<h4>
			<font color="blue">Latency</font>
		</h4>
		Another way to measure the speed of a computer network is <b>latency</b>. latency is the time between the sending of
		a data message and the receiving of that message, measured in milliseconds:
		<br>
		<center>
			<img src="latency.png" width="600px" height="300px">
		</center>
		My computer sends a message to the Google server. 30 milliseconds later, Google receives the message. 40
		milliseconds later, my computer gets an acknowledgement from Google that it received the message.
		That's a total round-trip latency of 70 ms. The latency depends on a number of physical factors: the type of
		connection from my computer to Google, the distance from my computer to the Google servers, and the congestion in
		the network.
		<br>
		<h4>
			<font color="blue">Internet speed</font>
		</h4>
		Speed is a combination of bandwidth and latency. You can measure the current speed of a network using an Internet
		speed test: a website that downloads and uploads data while tracking how quickly the data is transferred.
		Here are the results from an Internet speed test from my laptop: <br>
		<br>
		<center>
			<img src="speedTest.png" width="500px" height="350px">
		</center>
		<br>
		<!--
		The download bit rate is 204.1 Mbps and the upload bit rate is 22.1 Mbps, significantly less. Actually, that's
		expected. -->
		Internet providers often support a much faster download speed than upload speed, because Internet users
		spend much more time downloading data (reading articles, watching movies) than uploading data (writing blog posts,
		submitting forms).

		<h3>5. </h3>
		Taylor switched WiFi networks from an AT&T network to a Verizon network. He noticed his IP address changed. What's
		the best explanation for the change?

		<ul>
			<li>a. Verizon has a different set of IP addresses to allocate than AT&T, so Verizon had to give Taylor's computer
				a different IP address than the AT&T address.</li>
			<li>b. Taylor must have moved to a new location when switching WiFi, as each geographic location maps to a
				different IP address.</li>
			<li>c. Verizon thinks that their IP addresses are better, so they always upgrade users who use their WiFi.</li>
			<li>d. Computers assign themselves new IPs whenever the network changes, based on their internal table of possible
				IP addresses.</li>
