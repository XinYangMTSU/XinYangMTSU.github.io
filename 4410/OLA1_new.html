		<h2>Objective:</h2>
		In this assignment, you will create a <b>personal webpage</b> using an industry-inspired workflow:
		<b>(1) plan</b> your structure, <b>(2) build</b> your HTML, and <b>(3) reflect</b> on what changed and why.
		The goal is to showcase your understanding of basic HTML components, including
		<b>&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;, &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt;, &lt;meta&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;a&gt;,
			&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;li&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;th&gt;, &lt;td&gt;, &lt;thead&gt;, &lt;tbody&gt;,
			&lt;b&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;i&gt; or &lt;em&gt;, &lt;mark&gt;, and HTML comments &lt;!-- --&gt;.</b>
		<br><br>
		
		<h2>Step 1: Create Your First Webpage</h2>
		Here is the basic HTML structure: 
		<pre>
			&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
			&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
			&lt;head&gt;
   				 &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    				 &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
   				 &lt;title&gt; &lt;/title&gt;
			&lt;/head&gt;
			&lt;body&gt;
				
			&lt;/body&gt;
			&lt;/html&gt;
		</pre>
		
		Your webpage should include the following components:
			
		<h3>1. Title</h3> 
		Add a title to your webpage in the head section (e.g., "John Doe's Homepage").
		
		<h3>2. Introduction Paragraph</h3>
		Please write a paragraph to introduce yourself. In your paragraph, include details such as your name, 
		where you're from, your academic interests, and what you're passionate about. 
		You can also mention your hobbies, goals, or anything that helps others get to know you better. 
		This is your chance to share a little bit about yourself with your webpage visitors, 
		so feel free to include any interesting personal information you'd like to highlight!

		<h3>3. Image </h3>
		Please display an image that represents something you love or find meaningful, such as your favorite photo, 
		artwork, or a picture of a place you like. 
		You can resize the image using the <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> attributes to adjust its dimensions to fit your webpage properly. 
		You may use an online image or a local file (if using a local image, make sure to upload it with your submission).
		<strong>If you use an image from the internet or download it from a website, make sure to give credit to the original creator 
			and follow copyright rules by mentioning where the image is from.</strong>

		<h3>4. Hyperlink</h3>
		Please add a hyperlink to your favorite website.
		A hyperlink allows users to navigate to another webpage when they click on the link.
		Ensure the link is clearly labeled and directs to an external website of your choice.
		
		<h3>5. List</h3>
		Please create a bulleted list of your hobbies, interests, or foods you enjoy. 
		You can include any activities, sports, interests, or foods that you like.
		Be sure to use a different bullet style other than the default one.

		<h3>6. Table</h3>

		Please include a table that lists your favorite movies, books, songs, TV shows, or any other things that you love. 
		For example:<br><br>

		<table style="width:50%">
			<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Movie Title</th>
				<th>Director</th>
				<th>Year</th>
			</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>The God Father</td>
				<td>Francis Ford Coppola</td>
				<td>1972</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Forrest Gump </td>
				<td>Robert Zemeckis</td>
				<td>1994</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<br>
		<h3>7. Bookmark</h3>
		Please add a bookmark at the bottom of your webpage to allow users to quickly navigate back to the top of your webpage.
		This will improve the user experience, especially for longer pages.

		<h3>8. Headings</h3>
		Please use different heading tags (e.g., &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, etc.) to separate each part of your webpage.
		Use headings with varying levels of importance. 

		<h3>9. Text Formatting</h3>
		Please apply formatting (e.g., bold, italic, marked) to highlight important content or sections of your webpage.

		<h3>10. Comments</h3>
		Please add the necessary comments to your webpage, explaining different sections or components.

		<h2>Step 2: Submit</h2>
		Please submit your ola1.html in D2L. <br>

		<h2>Grading</h2>
		There are 100 points in total. 10 points for each of the parts from 1 to 10 in Step 1. <br><br>
