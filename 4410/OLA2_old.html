        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        In this assignment, you will enhance your web development skills by creating a comprehensive CV webpage and
        applying CSS styling and layout to your previous work. The tasks are designed to deepen your understanding of HTML
        structure, CSS styling, and Layout.

	<h2>Step 1: Design Your Website Layout</h2>

	<h3>1. Header</h3>
	A header is usually located at the top of the website. 
	It often contains a logo or a website name.
	    
	<h3>2. Navigation Bar</h3>
	Develop a navigation bar that allows users to switch between your Home page (OLA 1 personal webpage) and your CV
        page. Ensure that the navigation bar is present on both pages for seamless navigation.
	    
	<h3>3. Content Section</h3>
	    The content section displays the main information on each page, such as personal details, portfolio, or CV details. 
	    It should be structured with headings, paragraphs, and other elements for readability.
	    
	<h3>4. Footer</h3>
	    The footer provides supplementary information, such as copyright details and contact links. 
	    It may also include additional navigation, a return-to-top button, or disclaimers
	    
        <h2>Step 2: Create a CV Webpage in HTML/CSS</h2>
        Develop a new CV webpage using HTML and CSS. Your CV should include the following sections:
	
        <h3>1. Title</h3>
        Set an appropriate title for your CV, such as "John Doe's CV".

        <h3>2. Education Background</h3>
        Present your educational background using a list, table, or any other HTML structure you prefer. Include details
        like high school, bachelor's degree, and master's degree.

        <h3>3. Skills</h3>
        Display your skills, such as programming languages or software tools you are proficient in, using a list, table,
        or any other HTML structure you prefer.

        <h3>4. Work Experience</h3>
        Outline your work experience using a list, table, or any other HTML structure you prefer. If you do not have any
        work experience, you may skip this section.

        <h3>5. Research/Scholarly Activity</h3>
        Detail your research or scholarly activities using a list, table, or any other HTML structure you prefer. If you
        do not have any research or scholarly activities, you may skip this section.

        <h3>6. Awards</h3>
        List any awards you have received using a list, table, or any other HTML structure you prefer. If you do not have
        any awards, you may skip this section.

        <h3>7. Bookmark</h3>
        Include a bookmark link that allows users to quickly navigate back to the top of your webpage.

        <h3>8. Formatting</h3>
        Apply formatting to highlight important information in your CV.

        <h3>9. Comments</h3>
        Add necessary comments to your HTML code to explain different sections or components.

	<h3>10. CSS Styling</h3>
        Enhance the appearance of your CV by adding CSS styles. You can customize colors, backgrounds, font styles, and
        more to create a visually appealing design.

        <h2>Step 3: Create and Apply an External Style Sheet</h2>
        <h3>1. Create an External CSS File</h3>
	Develop a single external CSS file (e.g., styles.css) that will contain all the styling rules for
	both your OLA 1 and OLA 2 webpages.

	<h3>2. Link the External CSS File</h3>
	Incorporate a link to this external style sheet within the &lt;head&gt; section of both your OLA 1 and OLA 2 HTML files.
	</ul>


        <h2>Submission:</h2>
        
        Please compress all your assignment files (ola1.html, ola2.html, style.css, and other necessary files) 
	into a single ZIP archive and submit it through D2L.
