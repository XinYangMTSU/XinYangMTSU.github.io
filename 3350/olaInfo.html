		<h1>Late Submission Policy</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; Generally each OLA assignment must be turned in to the <b style="color:blue">D2L repository</b> by the end of the due
				date.</li>
			<li>&#9733; You may turn in the OLA late by <b>
					<font color="red">2 days without penalty</font>
				</b> If you have reasonable reasons, e.g. you are in an extreme situation (health issue, family emergencies, and
				so on). (You must discuss your eligibility with the instructor before the due date.) </li>
			<li>&#9733; Late Submission Policy:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>1 day late (-10 points)</li>
				<li>2 days late (-20 points)</li>
				<li>3 days late (-30 points)</li>
				<li>4 days late (-40 points)</li>
				<li>5 days late (-50 points)</li>
				<li>6 days late (-70 points)</li>
				<li>7 days late (-90 points)</li>
			</ul>

			<li>&#9733; <b>
					<font color="red">Overdue assignments will not be accepted 7 days after the due date.</font>
				</b> </li>
			<li>&#9733; <b><font color="blue">No Make Up for the Final Project Presentation</font></b></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Help</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; Feel free to ask the tutor questions if you need help on an open lab assignment.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>OLA Grading</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; Open lab assignments are graded on a 100-point scale.</li>
			<li>&#9733; Graded assignments are returned the next week. </li>
			<li>&#9733; The maximum grade you could get is <font color="red">60/100</font> if your source code has syntax
				errors.</li>
			<li>&#9733; It is a good idea to save graded assignments; if there is any disagreement about the recorded grades,
				you will need to show the graded assignment to document the mistake.</li>
		</ul>
