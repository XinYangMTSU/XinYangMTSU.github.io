		<h2>Academic Integrity/Misconduct</h2>

		Please review the information on <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/policies/academic-affairs-students/312.php"
			target="_blank">Academic Integrity and Misconduct</a>. The instructor will be submitting materials to
		an online service (Turnitin.com) that will review the work for plagiarism. Students should also review the report
		generated for each assignment and self-check for plagiarism. Information on how to cite work correctly is provided
		within the course modules or through the <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/writing-center/" target="_blank">University
			Writing Center</a>. You may read more about how to avoid plagiarism
		from the <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/provost/academic-integrity.php" target="_blank">Office of the University
			Provost</a>.

		<br>
		<br>
		Plagiarism, cheating, and other forms of academic dishonesty are prohibited. Such conduct includes, but is not
		limited to:
		<ul>
			<li>&#x2022; Submitting as one’s own work, themes, reports, drawings, laboratory notes, computer programs, or
				other projects prepared by another person</li>
			<li>&#x2022; Knowingly assisting another student in obtaining or using unauthorized materials</li>
			<li>&#x2022; Submitting assignments previously used in other courses where you received credit for the work</li>
			<li>&#x2022; Improperly crediting or lack of crediting an original author’s work</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		Students guilty of academic misconduct are immediately responsible to the instructor of the class. In addition to
		other possible disciplinary sanctions (including expulsion from the university), which may be imposed through the
		regular institutional procedures as a result of academic misconduct, the instructor has the authority to assign an
		“F” or zero for an activity or to assign an “F” for the course. Students guilty of plagiarism will be immediately
		reported to the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs.

		<h3 style="color: red">Artificial Intelligence</h3>
		All assignments must include a prominent disclaimer statement on the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) 
		at the very beginning of the assignment, regardless of whether you did or did not utilize artificial intelligence tools 
		(ChatGPT, MS Copilot, other LLMs, etc.) for your work. If such A.I. was utilized in any way for the assignment, 
		then comprehensive documentation of all input provided to, and output obtained from, the A.I. that is in any way related 
		to the assignment should be provided in PDF format.
		<br><br>
		For example, if you did not utilize AI in any manner for the assignment, you should put the following disclaimer at 
		the top of your assignment:
		<br><br>
		<b>A.I. Disclaimer</b>: All work for this assignment was completed by myself and entirely without the use of artificial 
		intelligence tools such as ChatGPT, MS Copilot, other LLMs, etc. 
		<br><br>
		However, if you did utilize AI in any manner for the assignment, then you should put the following disclaimer at the top of your assignment:
		<br><br>
		<b>A.I. Disclaimer</b>: This assignment was completed with the assistance of artificial intelligence tools, and a detailed record of the tools used, 
		the inputs provided, and the outputs obtained are included in my submission.
		You should then provide a list of all of the tools that were used to complete any part of the assignment, 
		and attach complete and comprehensive electronic transcripts of all your provided inputs to these tools and the outputs returned by these tools in 
		PDF format at the end of your assignment (or as a separate PDF document if submitting a ZIP archive). 
		<br><br>
		Failure to provide the A.I. disclaimer statement, 
		or appropriate documentation as requested above, will be treated as a violation of the academic integrity policy above.

		<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>

		Middle Tennessee State University is committed to campus access in accordance with Title II of the Americans with
		Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Any student interested in reasonable
		accommodations can consult the <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/dac/" target="_">Disability & Access Center (DAC)</a>
		website and/or contact the DAC for assistance at 615-898-2783 or DAC Email (dacemail@mtsu.edu).

		<h3>Tutoring</h3>
		MTSU Online supports multiple <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/university-college/distance/student-services.php"
			target="_">Online Student Services</a>.

		<h3>Grade Appeals</h3>

		<a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/policies/academic-affairs-students/313.php" target="_">University Policy 313</a>,
		Student Grade Appeals, provides an avenue for MTSU students to appeal a final course grade in
		cases in which the student alleges that unethical or unprofessional actions by the instructor and/or grading
		inequities improperly impacted the final grade.

		<h3 style="color: blue">Incomplete Grades</h3>

		Incomplete grades are given rarely and only in extenuating circumstances. Page 56 of the <a
			href="https://catalog.mtsu.edu/" target="_blank">MTSU Undergraduate Catalog</a>
		states: “The grade I indicates that the student has not completed all course requirements because of illness or
		other uncontrollable circumstances, especially those which occur toward the end of the term. Mere failure to make up
		work or turn in required work on time does not provide the basis for the grade of “I” unless extenuating
		circumstances noted above are present for reasons acceptable to the instructor.” Please refer to the Undergraduate
		catalog for the complete Incomplete Grade Policy.

		<h3>Title IX</h3>
		Students who believe they have been harassed, discriminated against or been the victim of sexual assault, dating
		violence, domestic violence or stalking should contact a Title IX/Deputy Coordinator at 615-898- 2185 or
		615-898-2750 for assistance or review <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/titleix/" target="_">MTSU’s Title IX website</a>
		for resources.
		<br>
		MTSU faculty are concerned about the well-being and development of our students and are legally obligated to share
		reports of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and stalking with the University’s Title IX
		coordinator to help ensure student’s safety and welfare. Please refer to <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/titleix/"
