        <h2>👋 What is Latin?</h2>
        <p>Latin is a magical old language that people in ancient Rome spoke about 2,000 to 2,700 years ago! 
           Even today, we still use Latin words in science, history, and even space! 🌙✨
           It’s like a secret code hiding inside the words we use every day, especially in books, scientific names, and ancient history!

        <h2>❓ Is Latin a Dead Language?</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The answer is: <b class="blue-text">Yes and No</b>, depending on how you define "dead language."
         </p>
        
            <h3>✅ Technically, yes – Latin is considered a "dead language."</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>&star; A "dead language" means no one speaks it as their native, everyday language anymore.</li>
                <li>&star; Latin stopped evolving naturally after the fall of the Roman Empire (around the 5th century AD).</li>
                <li>&star; People don’t grow up speaking Latin at home as they do with English, Spanish, or Chinese.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>❌ But Latin is still “alive” in many ways:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>&star; It’s still studied and used today!</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In schools, universities, and churches.</li>
                    <li>It's the official language of the Catholic Church (Ecclesiastical Latin).</li>
                    <li>Scientists, doctors, and lawyers use Latin roots and terms in medicine, law, and biology (e.g., homo sapiens, habeas corpus).</li>
                </ul>
                <li>&star; It "lives on" inside modern languages:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian all evolved from Latin (we call them Romance languages).</li>
                    <li>Even English has thousands of Latin-based words like aqua (water), lunar (moon-related), canine (dog-related), etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>&star; People still read, write, and even speak it! </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are modern Latin enthusiasts and groups that practice conversational Latin for fun or academic purposes.</li>
                    <li>Latin is also used in mottos, inscriptions, and ceremonial occasions.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        Latin is "dead" as a spoken native language, but it’s still very "alive" academically and culturally!
