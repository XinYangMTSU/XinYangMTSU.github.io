    </div>
   
    A long time ago, before people had books, movies, or video games, they told stories to explain the world around them. These special stories are called myths!
    The Romans loved to tell myths about powerful gods and brave heroes. They believed the gods lived high above the clouds on a magical mountain called <b class="blue-text"><a href="./olympus.html" target="_blank">Mount Olympus</a></b> (just like the Greeks did before them!). 
    Each god had a special job, like controlling the sky, sea, earth, or even love—for example, making thunder, watching over love, or protecting cities.
    The Romans told these stories to:
    <ul>
        <li><img width="17" height="17" tyle="vertical-align: middle; margin-bottom: 3px;" src="https://img.icons8.com/cute-clipart/64/grand-canyon.png" alt="grand-canyon"/> Explain nature, like why it rains or why the sun shines.</li>
        <li>🦉 Teach people how to be brave, kind, or wise.</li>
        <li>⚖️ Help everyone understand right from wrong.</li>
    </ul>
    These myths were full of magic, adventure, and mystery! ✨ Sometimes, the gods helped people, and sometimes they played tricks! 
    The Romans even believed that some heroes were part human and part god!

     <div class="fun-fact">
        🏰 <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Mount Olympus is the tallest mountain in Greece and is famous in Greek and Roman mythology as the legendary home of the gods.
         In mythology, Mount Olympus was believed to be the place where the gods and goddesses lived high above the clouds.

     <div class="fun-fact">
        🏠 <strong>Dii Consentes: </strong> In Roman mythology, there are 12 important gods and goddesses who were worshipped as the most powerful and special. 
        These gods were known as the <strong>Dii Consentes</strong>, which means "The Council of 12." They were like a big family 
        of gods who worked together to rule over different parts of life, such as the sky, sea, love, war, wisdom, and more!
