  Let’s look at the origin (etymology) of the word "reprimand."
  It comes from Latin:

  re- = again or back
  primandare (related to premere) = to press or command

  The full Latin phrase it evolved from was "reprimenda culpa", which meant "a fault to be checked" or "something that must be restrained or held back."

Then it came into French as réprimander (to scold),
and then into English in the 1600s, keeping a similar meaning:
👉 To officially scold or express disapproval.
