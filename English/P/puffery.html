    <p><span style="font-size: 2rem;">📚</span> Let’s look at the origin (etymology) of the word <strong>"puffery"</strong>.</p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 2rem;">📝</span>It comes from the English verb <strong>puff</strong>, meaning "to blow up" or "inflate," plus the noun suffix <strong>-ery</strong> which refers to behavior or practice.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>puff</strong> = to blow air, to inflate</li>
        <li><strong>-ery</strong> = a practice or behavior</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p><span style="font-size: 2rem;">✍️</span> "Puffery" literally means the behavior of inflating or exaggerating something's value.</p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 2rem;">💡</span> It became popular in law and advertising to describe exaggerations that are so obvious, they are not considered fraudulent.</p>
