		<h2>Some Sample Propositions</h2>
		A: There is a velociraptor outside my apartment. <br>
		B: Velociraptors can open windows. <br>
		C: I am in my apartment right now. <br>
		D: My apartment has windows. <br>
		E: I am going to be eaten by a velociraptor. <br>
		<br>
		Please translating the following english to propositional logic: <br>
		<br>
		(1) I won't be eaten by a velociraptor if there isn't a velociratpr outside my apartment.
		<b>
			<font color="red">&not;A &rarr; &not;E</font>
		</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		(2) If there is a velociraptor outside my apartment, but it can't open windows, I am not going
		to be eaten by a velociraptor. <b>
			<font color="red">A &and; &not;B &rarr; &not;E</font>
		</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		(3) I am only in my apartment when there are no velociraptors outside. <b>
			<font color="red">C &rarr; &not;A</font>
		</b>
		<br>
		<br>

		<h2>Well-formed formula (wff)</h2>
		An expression that is a legitimate string is called a <font color="blue"><b>well-formed formula</b></font> or <b>
			<font color="blue">wff</font>
		</b>.
		<br>
		<br>
		For example: <br>
		\( (A &rarr; B)&and;(B &rarr; A) \) is legal
		<br>
		\( A)) &and;&and; &rarr; B) \) is not legal
		<br>
		<br>
		To reduce the number of parentheses required in a wff, we stipulate an order in which connectivies are applied.
		<font color="blue"><b>This order of precedence</b></font> is: <br>
		<br>
		1. connectives within parentheses, innermost parentheses first <br>
		2. not: &not; <br>
		3. and: &and; <br>
		4. or: &or; <br>
		5. implies: &rarr; <br>
		6: equivalence: &harr; <br>
		<br>
		This means that the expression \(A &or; B'\) stands for \(A &or; (B')\), not \((A &or; B)'\). Similarly, \(A &or; B
		&rarr; C\) means \((A &or; B) &rarr; C\), not \(A &or; (B &rarr; C)\). However, we often use parentheses anyway,
		just to be sure there is no confusion.

		<h2>main connective</h2>
		In a wff with a number of connectives, the connective to be applied last is the
		<b>
			<font color="blue">main connective</font>
		</b>. In, <br>
		<br>
		<center>
			\(A &and; (B &rarr; C)'\)
		</center>
		the main connective is &and;. In <br>
		<center>
			\(((A &or; B) &and; C) &rarr; (B &or; C')\)
		</center>
		<br>
		the main connective is &rarr;. Capital letters near the end of the alphabet, such as
		\(P, Q, R, and S\) are used to represent wffs. Thus \(P\) could represent a single
		statement letter, which is the simplest kind of wff, or a more complex wff. We might represent <br>
		<center>
			\(((A &or; B) &and; C) &rarr; (B &or; C')\)
		</center>
		<br>
		as <br>
		<center>
			\(P &rarr; Q\)
		</center>
		<br>
		if we want to hide some of the details for the moment and only concentrate on the main connective.

		<h2>Truth table for any wff</h2>

		Wffs composed of statement letters and connectives have truth values that depend on
		the truth values assigned to their statement letters. We write the truth table
		for any wff by building up the component parts, just as we did for \((A &rarr; B) &and; (B &rarr; A)\). The main
		connective is addressed in the last column of the table.
		<br>
		<br>
		The truth table for the wff \(A &or; B' &rarr; (A &or; B)'\) is given in Table 2. The main connective, acorrding to
		the rules of precedence, is implication (\(&rarr;\))
		<br>

		<h2>Practice Examples</h2>
		Please construct truth tables for the following wffs. <br>
		<br>
		(1) (\(A &rarr; B\)) &harr; (B &rarr; A)
		<br>
		(2) \( (A &or; A') &rarr; (B &and; B') \)
		<br>
		(3) \( [(A &and; B') &rarr; C']' \)
		<br>
		(4)\( (A &rarr; B) &harr; (B' &rarr; A') \)

		<br>

		<h2>Application</h2>
		Here are just a few examples, spanning the entire range of computing applications, from practical commercial
		software to esoteric theory:
		<br>
		<Br>
		&bull; In software engineering it is good practice to specify what a system should do before starting to code it.
		Logic is frequently used for software specifications.
		<Br>
		<Br>
		&bull; In information retrieval, including Web search engines, logical propositions are used to specify the
		properties that should (or should not) be present in a piece of information in order for it to be considered
		relevant.
		<br>
		<Br>
		&bull; In artificial intelligence, formal logic is sometimes used to simulate intelligent thought processes. People
		don't do their ordinary reasoning using mathematical logic, but logic is a convenient tool for implementing certain
		forms of reasoning.
