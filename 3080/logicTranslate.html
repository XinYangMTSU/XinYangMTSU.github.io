		<h2>Some Sample Propositions</h2>
		A: There is a velociraptor outside my apartment. <br>
		B: Velociraptors can open windows. <br>
		C: I am in my apartment right now. <br>
		D: My apartment has windows. <br>
		E: I am going to be eaten by a velociraptor. <br>
		<br>
		Please translate the following English to propositional logic: <br>
		<br>
		(1) I won't be eaten by a velociraptor if there isn't a velociraptor outside my apartment.
		<b>
			<font color="red">&not;A &rarr; &not;E</font>
		</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		The statement can be interpreted as: 
		<pre>
		If there is not a velociraptor outside my apartment, 
		then I won't be eaten by a velociraptor.
		</pre>
		
		(2) If there is a velociraptor outside my apartment, but it can't open windows, I am not going
		to be eaten by a velociraptor. <b>
			<font color="red">A &and; &not;B &rarr; &not;E</font>
		</b>
		<br>
		<br>

		The statement can be interpreted as: 
		<pre>
		If there is a velociraptor outside my apartment and it can't open windows,
		then I am not going to be eaten by a velociraptor.
		</pre>
		
		(3) I am only in my apartment when there are no velociraptors outside. <b>
			<font color="red">C &rarr; &not;A</font>
		</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		The statement can be interpreted as: 
		<pre>
		I am only in my apartment if there are no velociraptors outside.
		</pre>
		
		<h2>More Examples</h2>

		(1) Please rewrite the following each statement in <b><font color="blue">if-then</font></b> form:
		<br><br>
		a. If the rain continues, then the river will flood. <br>
		b. A sufficient condition for network failure is that the central switch goes down. <br>
		c. The avocados are ripe only if they are dark and soft. <br>
		d. A good diet is a necessary condition for a healthy cat. <br>

		<br>
		<br>
		(2) Expressing the <b><font color="blue">negation</font></b> of a statement must be done with care, 
		especially for a compound statement. Table 3 gives some examples.

					Peter is not tall or he is not thin. <br><br>

					<th>Peter is short and fat. <br><br>
					Too strong a statement. Peter fails to have both properties (tallness and thinness) but may still have one property.</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>The river is shallow or polluted.</th>

					The river is neither shallow nor polluted.<br><br>
					The river is deep and unpolluted.</th>
					<th>The river is not shallow or not polluted.<br><br>
					Too weak a statement. The river fails to have either property, not just fails to have one property.</th>

		(3) Which of the following represents \( A' \) if \( A \) is the statement 
		"Julie likes butter but hates cream"? <br>
		<br>
		a. Julie hates butter and cream. <br>
		b. Julie does not like butter or cream. <br>
		c. Julie dislikes butter but loves cream. <br>

		<h2>Well-formed formula (wff)</h2>
		An expression that is a legitimate string is called a <font color="blue"><b>well-formed formula</b></font> or <b>
			<font color="blue">wff</font>
		</b>.
		<br>
		<br>
		A <font color="blue"><b>well-formed formula (WFF)</b></font> is a key concept in formal logic, particularly in propositional logic. 
		A well-formed formula is a syntactically correct arrangement of symbols and operators according to the rules of the logical system. 
		It represents a meaningful expression within the system that can be evaluated as true or false.
		<br><br>
		It must be constructed using the allowed symbols (such as variables, logical connectives, and parentheses) 
		in a way that adheres to the formation rules of that system. 
		Parentheses are used in WFFs to indicate the order of operations and ensure that the formula is unambiguous.
		<br><br>
		For example: <br>
		\( (A &rarr; B)&and;(B &rarr; A) \) is legal
		<br>
		\( A)) &and;&and; &rarr; B) \) is not legal
		<br>
		<br>
		To reduce the number of parentheses required in a wff, we stipulate an order in which connectivies are applied.
		<font color="blue"><b>This order of precedence</b></font> is: <br>
		<br>
		1. connectives within parentheses, innermost parentheses first <br>
		2. not: &not; <br>
		3. and: &and; <br>
		4. or: &or; <br>
		5. implies: &rarr; <br>
		6: equivalence: &harr; <br>
		<br>
		This means that the expression \(A &or; B'\) stands for \(A &or; (B')\), not \((A &or; B)'\). Similarly, \(A &or; B
		&rarr; C\) means \((A &or; B) &rarr; C\), not \(A &or; (B &rarr; C)\). However, we often use parentheses anyway,
		just to be sure there is no confusion.

		<h2>main connective</h2>
		In a wff with a number of connectives, the connective to be applied last is the
		<b>
			<font color="blue">main connective</font>
		</b>. In, <br>
		<br>
		<center>
			\(A &and; (B &rarr; C)'\)
		</center>
		the main connective is &and;. In <br>
		<center>
			\(((A &or; B) &and; C) &rarr; (B &or; C')\)
		</center>
		<br>
		the main connective is &rarr;. Capital letters near the end of the alphabet, such as
		\(P, Q, R, and S\) are used to represent wffs. Thus \(P\) could represent a single
		statement letter, which is the simplest kind of wff, or a more complex wff. We might represent <br>
		<center>
			\(((A &or; B) &and; C) &rarr; (B &or; C')\)
		</center>
		<br>
		as <br>
		<center>
			\(P &rarr; Q\)
		</center>
		<br>
		if we want to hide some of the details for the moment and only concentrate on the main connective.

		<h2>Truth table for any wff</h2>

		Wffs composed of statement letters and connectives have truth values that depend on
		the truth values assigned to their statement letters. We write the truth table
		for any wff by building up the component parts, just as we did for \((A &rarr; B) &and; (B &rarr; A)\). The main
		connective is addressed in the last column of the table.
		<br>
		<br>
		The truth table for the wff \(A &or; B' &rarr; (A &or; B)'\) is given in Table 2. The main connective, acorrding to
		the rules of precedence, is implication (\(&rarr;\))

		<h2>Practice Examples</h2>
		Please construct truth tables for the following wffs. <br>
		<br>
		(1) (\(A &rarr; B\)) &harr; (B &rarr; A)
		<br>
		(2) \( (A &or; A') &rarr; (B &and; B') \)
		<br>
		(3) \( [(A &and; B') &rarr; C']' \)
		<br>
		(4)\( (A &rarr; B) &harr; (B' &rarr; A') \)

		<br>

		<h2>Application</h2>
		Here are just a few examples, spanning the entire range of computing applications, from practical to theory:
		<br>
		<Br>
		<h3>Computer Networks:</h3>
		&bull; Firewall rules and access control lists are often based on propositional logic. Rules are defined using logical expressions to allow or deny traffic based on conditions like source IP, 
		destination IP, and protocol. <br><br>
		Example:
		<br>
		A firewall rule might state: "Allow traffic if it is from IP 192.168.1.1 AND it is using port 80." 
		In propositional logic, this can be represented as <b>IP = 192.168.1.1 AND Port = 80</b>.
		<br>
		
		
		<Br>
		<h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
		&bull; In artificial intelligence, formal logic is sometimes used to simulate intelligent thought processes. People
		don't do their ordinary reasoning using mathematical logic, but logic is a convenient tool for implementing certain
		forms of reasoning. 
		Propositional logic is used in AI search algorithms to represent and explore possible states in problem-solving scenarios.
		<br><br> 
		Example: <br>
		In a puzzle-solving AI, each possible move can be represented as a logical statement. 
		The AI evaluates these statements to determine which moves lead to a solution.
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Computability Theory</h3>
		&bull; Theoretical models like Turing machines use logic to define what problems can be computed. 
		This involves understanding the limits of computation and which problems are decidable or undecidable.
		<br><br>
