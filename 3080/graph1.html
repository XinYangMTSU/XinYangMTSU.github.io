			<h2>Section 6.1 Graphs and Their Representations</h2>
		</center>

		<br>
		<br>
		Graphs are a fundamental concept in discrete mathematics that represent relationships between objects. 
		They are widely used in computer science, transportation, social networks, chemistry, and artificial intelligence. 
		This section explains what graphs are, their different types, and their representations.

		<h1>Graph and Their Representations</h1>
		Graphs are formal mathematical representations of networks, collections of objects, events,
		or set elements that lead naturally from one to another.

		<br>
		<h2>Graph (Informal Definition)</h2>
		A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges (arcs). 
		These connections represent relationships between entities.
		A <b>
			<font color="blue">graph</font>
		</b> is a nonempty set of <b>
			<font color="blue">nodes(vertices)</font>
		</b> and a set of <b>
			<font color="blue">arcs(edges)</font>
		</b> such that each arc connects two nodes. <br>
		Our graphs will always have a finite number of nodes and arcs. <br>
		<br>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">Example 1:</font>
		</b> <br>
		<br>
		In the graph below, the <b>
			<font color="blue">vertices</font>
		</b> represents the cities, and the <b>
			<font>edges</font>
		</b> are the distance between them.<Br>
		<br>
		The set of nodes in the airline map of Figure 1 is {Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Detroit, Austin, Washington,
		Seattle, San Francisco}. There are 12 arcs; Singapore-Tokyo is an arc (here we are naming an arc by the nodes it
		connects), Detroit-Austin is an arc, and so on. <br>

		</center>
		<br>
		The informal definition of a graph works quite well if we have the visual representation of the graph before us to
		show which arcs connect which nodes. Without the picture, however, we need a concise way to convey this information.
		Hence our second definition of a graph.

		<h2>Graph (Formal Definition)</h2>
		A <b>
			<font color="blue">graph G</font>
		</b> is an ordered pair G=(V,E) where <br><br>
		&bull; <b>
			<font color="red">V</font>
		</b> is a nonempty set of <b>
			<font color="blue">nodes(vertices)</font>
		</b> <br><br>
		&bull; <b>
			<font color="red">E</font>
		</b> is a set of <b>
			<font color="blue">arcs(edges)</font>
		</b> <br><br>
		&bull; Each edge is a pair of vertices.
		<br>
		<br>
		In other words, each element of E is a pair of elements of V.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">Example 2:</font>
		</b> <br><br>
		In the graph below, the <b>
			<font color="blue">vertices</font>
		</b> represents the circles, and the <b>
			<font>edges</font>
		</b> are the lines between them.<Br>
		<br>
		<center>
			<img width="400px" height="200px" src="images/graph2.png"><br>
			<caption>Figure 2</caption>
		</center>
		<br>
		For the graph of Figure 2 represents the following graph: <br>
		<br>
		&bull; V = {1,2,3,4,5,6} <br><br>
		&bull; E = {{1,2}, {1,5}, {2,3}, {2,5} {3,4}, {4,5}, {4,6}} <br><br>
		&bull; G = (V,E)
		<!--
&bull; V = {Singapore, Detroit, Austin, Tokyo, Washington, Seattle, Hong Kong, San Francisco} <br><br>
&bull; E = {{Singapore, Tokyo}, {Tokyo, Detroit}, {Detroit, Austin}, {Austin, Washinton DC}, 
{Austin,San Francisco},{Tokyo, Hong Kong},{Tokyo, Washingon DC}, {San Francisco, Seattle},
{San Francisco, Hong Kong}, {San Francisco, Washington DC}, {Hong Kong, Singapore},{Tokyo, Washington DC}}
-->
		<br>
		<h2>Undirected and Directed</h2>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">Undirected graph:</font>
		</b> The edges of a graph are assumed to be unordered pairs of
		nodes. Sometimes we say undirected graph to emphasize this point. In an undirected graph, we write edges using
		curly braces to denote unordered paris. For example, an undirected edge {2,3} from vertex 2 to vertex 3 is the same
		thing as an undirected edge {3,2} from vertex 3 to vertex 2. <br>
		<Br>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">Direct graph:</font>
		</b> In a directed graph, the two directions are counted as being
		distinct direted edges. In an directed graph, we write edges using parentheses to denote ordered pairs.
		For example, edge (2,3) is directed from 2 to 3, which is different than the directed edge (3,2) from 3 to 2.
		Directed graphs are drawn with arrowheads on the links, as shown below: <br>
		<br>

		</center>
		<br>

		<b>
			<font color="blue">In this class, the term <font color="red">"graph"</font> will mean an <font color="red">
					undirected graph</font>. To
				refer to a <font color="red">directed graph</font>, we
				will always say <font color="red">"directed graph"</font>.</font>
		</b>
		<br>
		<br>

		<h2>Labeled Graph and Weighted Graph</h2>
		Besides imposing direction on the arcs of a graph, we may want to modify the basic definiton of a graph in other
		ways. We often want the nodes of a graph to carry identifying information, like the names of the cities in
		the map of airline routes. This map would be a <b>
			<font color="blue">labeled graph</font>
		</b>. We may want to use a <b>
			<font color="blue">weighted graph</font>
		</b>, where each arc has some numerical value, or weight, associated with it. For example, we might want to indicate
		the price of the various routes in the airline map.
		<br>
		<center>
			<img width="800px" height="400px" src="images/graph4.png"><br>
			<caption>Figure 4</caption>
		</center>
		<br>
		Figure 4 represents a labeled and weighted graph, where each edge has a numerical value indicating the price. <br>

		<h2>Applications of Graphs</h2>
		(1) The Internet, for example, is a vast, virtual graph. Every vertex is an individual webpage, and every edge means
		that there is a hyperlink between two pages.

		(2) Graphs also play an important role in transportation and navigation. All flight, train and subway networks form
		graphs, which can be used when creating efficient schedules. One of the most recognisable graphs is the London
		Underground map: <br>

		(3) The links between atoms in molecules and crystal grids form a graph.
