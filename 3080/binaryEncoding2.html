		<h1>Binary Encoding</h1>

		Although the binary number system has many practical advantages and is widely used in digital computers, in many
		cases it is convenient to work with the decimal number system, especially when the communication between man
		and the machine is extensive since most numerical data generated by man are in terms of decimal numbers. To simplify
		the communication problem between man and machine, a number of codes have been devised so that the decimal
		digits are represented by sequences of binary digits.

		<h2>Nonweighted Codes</h2>
		In this type of binary code, the positional weights are not assigned. The examples of non-weighted codes are
		Excess-3 code and Gray code.

		<h3>
			<font color="red">Excess-3 code</font>

		The Excess-3 code is also called as XS-3 code. It is a non-weighted code used to express decimal numbers. The Excess-3
		code words are derived from the 8421 BCD code words adding \( (0011)_2 \)or \( (3)_{10} \) to each code word in
		8421. The excess-3 codes are obtained as follows :

		</center>

		The <b>Excess-3 code</b> is a binary-coded decimal (BCD) representation where each decimal digit is represented by its 4-bit binary equivalent plus 3.
		It is a <b>self-complementary code</b> used in digital systems for error detection and arithmetic operations.
		The <b>1's complement of the Excess-3 code</b> aligns with the <B>Excess-3 code of \(9-N\)</B>, which is why it's self-complementing.

		<h3>Excess-3 code Application</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Error Detection Example</li>
			<b>Scenario: Decimal Value Transmission in a Digital System</b>
			<br>
			Suppose we need to send a sequence of decimal number over a network, and we encode them using Excess-3:
			<br>
			Decimal 4: Excess-3 code 0111
			<br><br>
			<b>Error Scenario:</b><br>
			A single-bit error occurs during transmission, and 0111 (for 4) is received as 1111.<br>
			<br>
			<B>Error Detection Process:</b><br>
			<ul>
				<li>1. <b>Check the received code 1111</b></li><br>
				Is it a valid Excess-3 code? <b>No</b><br>
				Valid Excess-3 codes: 0011, 0100, 0101, ..., 1100. <br>
				<li>2. <b>Action</b>: Since 1111 is invalid, the system flags it as an error.</li>
			</ul>
			This simple check prevents corrupted data from being misinterpreted, improving the reliability of communication systems.

			It is a non-weighted code and it is not an arithmetic code. That means there are no specific weights assigned to
			the bit position. It has a very special feature that, only one bit will change each time the decimal number is
			incremented as shown in Fig. As only one-bit changes at a time, the gray code is called as a unit distance code.
			The gray code is a <b>
				<font color="blue">cyclic code</font>
			</b>. Gray code cannot be used for arithmetic operations.
			In this code, two consecutive values are differed by one bit of binary digits.

			The n-bit Gray code is a member of a class called reflected codes. The term ″reflected″ is used to designate codes
			which have the property that the n-bit code can be generated by reflecting the (n-1)st-bit code, as illustrated
			here

			<h3>Gray code Application</h3>
			Rotary Encoders: Gray code is commonly employed in rotary encoders, which are used in various devices like
			robotics, industrial control systems, and navigation systems. It ensures accurate tracking of rotational position
			by encoding the position values in Gray code, where only one bit changes at a time. This property helps to prevent
			errors or glitches during the position tracking process.
