		<h2>COURSE INFORMATION</h2>
		<h3 style="color: blue">Description</h3>

		This course is a fundamental mathematics course for computer scientists. Topics include formal logic, proof
		techniques, matrices, graphs, finite state machines, Turing machines, and binary encoding schemes. 
		This course consists of lectures, written assignments, programming labs, and non-graded quizzes.

		<h3 style="color: blue">Objectives</h3>

		The primary goal of this course is to introduce students to theoretical concepts, data structures, and algorithms
		in discrete mathematics to establish a theoretical basis for future study in computing applications and
		algorithms. Upon successful completion of this course, the students should be able to demonstrate the following
		learning outcomes:

		<ul>
			<li> <b>An understanding of concepts of formal logic such as statements, symbolic representation,
				tautologies,
				propositional logic, and validity.</b></li>
			<li> <b>An understanding of proof techniques, induction, recursive definitions, and recurrence relations.</b>
			</li>
			<li> <b>An understanding of matrix operations.</b></li>
			<li> <b>An understanding of graphs and trees and their representations.</b></li>
			<li> <b>An understanding of various graph algorithms.</b></li>
			<li> <b>An understanding of finite state machines, Turing machines, and formal languages.</b></li>
			<li> <b>An understanding of various encoding schemes.</b></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Topics Covered</h2>

		<h3 style="color: blue">Key topics covered include:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Selected portions of Chapters 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 in the book. </li>
			<li> The Handout on Encoding
				Schemes
				located on the course website will be covered during the semester (ChX).</li>
			<li> Ch1, Ch2, Ch3, Ch5, Ch6, Ch7, Ch9, ChX</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Prerequisites and Co-requisites</h2>

		
		CSCI 1170-Computer Science I and MATH 1910-Calculus I or consent of instructor. Since the course covers approximately one new mathematics concept each class meeting, it is
		imperative that students have the mathematical experience to learn new concepts quickly. To that end, students must
		have completed MATH 1910 or equivalent with a grade of C (2.0) or better before taking this course. Additionally,
		since there will be several programming assignments, students will need a fundamental knowledge of functional
		programming. To that end, students must have completed CSCI 1170 or equivalent with a grade of C (2.0) or better
		before taking this course.

		then comprehensive documentation of all input provided to, and output obtained from, the A.I. that is in any way related 
		to the assignment should be provided in PDF format.
		<br><br>
		For example, if you did not utilize AI in any manner for the assignment, you should put the following disclaimer at 
		the top of your assignment:
		<br><br>
		<b>A.I. Disclaimer</b>: All work for this assignment was completed by myself and entirely without the use of artificial 
		intelligence tools such as ChatGPT, MS Copilot, other LLMs, etc. 
		<br><br>
		However, if you did utilize AI in any manner for the assignment, then you should put the following disclaimer at the top of your assignment:
		<br><br>
		<b>A.I. Disclaimer</b>: This assignment was completed with the assistance of artificial intelligence tools, and a detailed record of the tools used, 
		the inputs provided, and the outputs obtained are included in my submission.
		You should then provide a list of all of the tools that were used to complete any part of the assignment, 
		and attach complete and comprehensive electronic transcripts of all your provided inputs to these tools and the outputs returned by these tools in 
		PDF format at the end of your assignment (or as a separate PDF document if submitting a ZIP archive). 
		<br><br>
		Failure to provide the A.I. disclaimer statement, 
		or appropriate documentation as requested above, will be treated as a violation of the academic integrity policy above.
