		<h2>COURSE INFORMATION</h2>
		<h3 style="color: blue">Description</h3>

		This course is a fundamental mathematics course for computer scientists. Topics include formal logic, proof
		techniques, matrices, graphs, finite state machines, Turing machines, and binary encoding schemes. 
		This course includes Lectures, Coding Exercises, Quizzes, and Assignments.

		<h3 style="color: blue">Objectives</h3>

		The primary goal of this course is to introduce students to the theoretical concepts, data structures and algorithms
		in discrete mathematics in order to establish a theoretical basis for future study in computing applications and
		algorithms. Upon successful completion of this course, the students should be able to demonstrate the following
		learning outcomes:

		<ul>
			<li> <b>An understanding of concepts of formal logic such as statements, symbolic representation,
				tautologies,
				propositional logic, and validity.</b></li>
			<li> <b>An understanding of proof techniques, induction, recursive definitions, and recurrence relations.</b>
			</li>
			<li> <b>An understanding of matrix operations.</b></li>
			<li> <b>An understanding of graphs and trees and their representations.</b></li>
			<li> <b>An understanding of various graphs algorithms.</b></li>
			<li> <b>An understanding of finite state machines, Turing machines, and formal languages.</b></li>
			<li> <b>An understanding of various encoding schemes.</b></li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Topics Covered</h2>

		<h3 style="color: blue">Key topics covered include:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Selected portions of Chapters 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 in the book. </li>
			<li> The Handout on Encoding
				Schemes
				located on the course website will be covered during the semester (ChX).</li>
			<li> Ch1, Ch2, Ch3, Ch5, Ch6, Ch7, Ch9, ChX</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Prerequisites and Co-requisites</h2>

		
		CSCI 1170-Computer Science I and MATH 1910-Calculus I or consent of instructor. Since the course covers approximately one new mathematics concept each class meeting, it is
		imperative that students have the mathematical experience to learn new concepts quickly. To that end, students must
		have completed MATH 1910 or equivalent with a grade of C (2.0) or better prior to taking this course. Additionally,
		since there will be several programming assignments, students will need a fundamental knowledge of functional
		programming. To that end, students must have completed CSCI 1170 or equivalent with a grade of C (2.0) or better
		prior to taking this course.

				graded based upon correctness, and compliance with requirements.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li> <b><font color="#aa00ff">Tests</font></b>
				Two in-class tests will be given. The tests will include questions related to handout materials, textbook
				materials, and open lab assignments.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li> <b><font color="#aa00ff">Final Exam</font></b>
				The final exam is comprehensive. The final exam will include questions related to handout materials, textbook
				materials, programming projects, and open lab assignments. 
			</li>
			<br>
			<li> <b><font color="#aa00ff">Programming Project</font></b>
				It will contain a programming problem that you need to solve by coding and debugging the programs. Programs are graded based upon design, correctness, documentation, style, efficiency, and compliance with
				requirements.
			</li>
			<br>
			<li> <b><font color="#aa00ff"><a href="https://xinyangmtsu.github.io/3080/attendance.html" target="_blank">Attendance</a></font></b>
				Attendance is mandatory. You are expected to attend all classes and to arrive on time. I will take attendance

		<h3 style="color: blue">Advice for succeeding in this course:</h3>

		<ul>
			<li> Attend every class.</li>
			<li> Don’t wait until the test time to ask questions. Instead, ask questions in class, or immediately
				after the lecture to clear any misunderstandings.</li>
			<li> Start working on the open lab assignments as soon as possible, and seek help as soon as needed.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 style="color: blue">Incomplete Grades</h3>

		Incomplete grades are given rarely and only in extenuating circumstances. Page 56 of the <a
			href="https://catalog.mtsu.edu/" target="_blank">MTSU Undergraduate Catalog</a>
		states: “The grade I indicates that the student has not completed all course requirements because of illness or
		other uncontrollable circumstances, especially those which occur toward the end of the term. Mere failure to make up
		work or turn in required work on time does not provide the basis for the grade of “I” unless extenuating
		circumstances noted above are present for reasons acceptable to the instructor.” Please refer to the Undergraduate
		catalog for the complete Incomplete Grade Policy.

		<br>

		Students guilty of academic misconduct are immediately responsible to the instructor of the class. In addition to
		other possible disciplinary sanctions (including expulsion from the university), which may be imposed through the
		regular institutional procedures as a result of academic misconduct, the instructor has the authority to assign an
		“F” or zero for an activity or to assign an “F” for the course. Students guilty of plagiarism will be immediately
		reported to the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs.

		<h3 style="color: red">Artificial Intelligence</h3>
		All assignments must include a prominent disclaimer statement on the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) 
		at the very beginning of the assignment, regardless of whether you did or did not utilize artificial intelligence tools 
		(ChatGPT, MS Copilot, other LLMs, etc.) for your work. If such A.I. was utilized in any way for the assignment, 
		then comprehensive documentation of all input provided to, and output obtained from, the A.I. that is in any way related 
		to the assignment should be provided in PDF format.
		<br><br>
		For example, if you did not utilize AI in any manner for the assignment, you should put the following disclaimer at 
		the top of your assignment:
		<br><br>
		<b>A.I. Disclaimer</b>: All work for this assignment was completed by myself and entirely without the use of artificial 
		intelligence tools such as ChatGPT, MS Copilot, other LLMs, etc. 
		<br><br>
		However, if you did utilize AI in any manner for the assignment, then you should put the following disclaimer at the top of your assignment:
		<br><br>
		<b>A.I. Disclaimer</b>: Work for this assignment was completed with the aid of artificial intelligence tools and comprehensive documentation of the names of, 
		input provided to, and output obtained from, these tools is included as part of my assignment submission.
		You should then provide a list of all of the tools that were used to complete any part of the assignment, 
		and attach complete and comprehensive electronic transcripts of all your provided inputs to these tools and the outputs returned by these tools in 
		PDF format at the end of your assignment (or as a separate PDF document if submitting a ZIP archive). Failure to provide the A.I. disclaimer statement, 
		or appropriate documentation as requested above, will be treated as a violation of the academic integrity policy above.
