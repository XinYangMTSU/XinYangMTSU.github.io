		<h1>Regular Sets and Kleene's Theorem</h1>
		We want a compact, symbolic way to describe sets such as those appearing in the answer to Practice 49. We will
		describe such sets by using <b>
			<font color="blue">regular expressions</font>
		</b>; each regular expression describes a particular set. 
		<br><br>
		(Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex or regexp, are sequences of characters that define a search pattern. They are used in various programming languages and text-processing tools to find and manipulate strings of text based on specific patterns.
		Regular expressions are a powerful tool for text processing and manipulation, but they can also be complex and difficult to understand at first. However, once you become familiar with their syntax and usage, they can greatly simplify many text-processing tasks.)

		In formally, an element in AB is an item from A followed by an item from B. An element in \(A &or; B\) is a single
		item chosen from either A or B. An element in (A)* is zero or more repetitions of elements from A. We note that
		&lambda;, the empty string, is a member of the set represented by A* for any A because it is the case of zero
		repetitions of elements from A. In writing regular expressions, we can eliminate parentheses when no ambiguity
		results. The regular expression 0* &or; 10 therefore consists of \(&lambda;, 0, 00, 000, 0000, ..., 10.\)

		We have introduced regular sets because, as it turns out, these are exactly the sets finite-state machines are
		capable of recognizing. This result was first proved by the American mathematician Stephen Kleene in 1956. We state
		his theorem here without proof.

		<b><font color="blue">Kleene's Theorem</font></b> is a foundational result in automata theory and formal languages, formulated by mathematician Stephen Kleene. 
		The theorem establishes an equivalence between regular expressions and finite automata, showing that they define the same class of languages, known as regular languages.

		<br><br>
		Kleeneâ€™s Theorem states that:

		<ul>
			<li>Every language that can be described by a regular expression can also be recognized by a finite state machine.</li>
			<li>Every language that can be recognized by a finite state machine can also be described by a regular expression.</li>
		</ul>
