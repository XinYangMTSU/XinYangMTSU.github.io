		<h1>Chapter 1: Formal Logic</h1>

		<center>
			<h2>Section 1.2 Propositional Logic</h2>
		</center>

		<br>
		<br>

		<h1>Verbal Arguments</h1>
		An argument in English (an attorney's trial summary, an advertisement, or a political speech) that consists of
		simple statements can be tested for validity by a two-step process:
		<br>
		<br>
		1. Symbolize the argument using propositional wffs. <Br>
		2. Prove that the argument is valid by constructing a proof sequence for it using the derivation rules for
		propositional logic. <Br>

		<h2>The rule of hypothetical syllogism (hs)</h2>
		From \(P &rarr; Q\) and \(Q &rarr; R\), one can derive \(P &rarr; R\). <Br>
		<br>
		This rule is making the claim that: <br>
		<Br>
		<center>
			\( (P &rarr; Q) &and; (Q &rarr; R) &rarr; (P &rarr; R) \)
		</center>
		is a valid statement.
		<br>
		<h2>Example 1</h2>
		Consider the argument, "If interest rates drop, the housing market will improve.
		Either the federal discount rate will drop or the housing market will not improve.
		Interest rates will drop. Therefore the federal discount rate will drop." Using
		<Br>
		<br>
		I: Interest rates drop. <Br>
		H: The housing market will improve. <Br>
		F: The federal discount rate will drop. <Br>
		<br>
		the argument is <br>
		<br>
		<center>
			\( (I &rarr; H) &and; (F &or; H') &and; I &rarr; F \)
		</center>
		<br>
		A proof sequence to establish validity:
		<br>
		1. \(I &rarr; H\) (hyp) <Br>
		2. \(F &or; H'\) (hyp) <Br>
		3. \(I\) (hyp) <br>
		<br>
		4. \( H' &or; F \) (2 comm) <br>
		5. \( H &rarr; F\) (4 imp) <br>
		6. \( I &rarr; F\) (1,5,hs) <br>
		7. \( F\) (3,6, mp) <br>
		<br>

		<h2>Example 2</h2>
		Use propotitional logic to prove that the following argument is valid. Use statement
		letters S, R and B. <br>
		<br>
		"If security is a problem, then regulation will be increased. If security is not
		a problem, then business on the Web will grow. Therefore if regulation is not
		increased, then business on the Web will grow."
		<br>
		<br>
		S: Security is a problem <br>
		R: Regulation will be increased. <br>
		B: Business on the Web will grow. <br>
		<br>
		the argument is: <br>
		<center>
			\( (S &rarr; R) &and; (S' &rarr; B) &rarr; (R' &rarr; B)\)
		</center>
		<br>
		1. \(S &rarr; R\) (hyp) <br>
		2. \(S' &rarr; B\) (hyp) <br>
		3. \(R'\) (hyp) <br>
		<br>
		4. \( S'\) (1,3 mt) <br>
		5. \(B\) (2,4 mp) <br>
		<br>
		<br>



		<h2>Practice</h2>

		1. Use propotitional logic to prove that the following argument is valid. Use statement letters E, Q and B.
		<br>
		<br>
		"If the program is efficient, it executes quickly. Either the program is efficient, or it has a bug. However, the
		program does not execute quickly. Therefore, it has a bug."

		<br><br>
		2. Use propotitional logic to prove that the following argument is valid. Use statement letters C, W, R, and S.
		<br>
		<br>
		"The crop is good, but there is not enough water. If there is a lot of rain or not a lot of sun, then there is
		enough water. Therefore, the crop is good and there is a lot of sun."
