		<h2>COURSE INFORMATION</h2>

		<h3>Description</h3>

		This course is a fundamental mathematics course for computer scientists. Topics include formal
logic, proof techniques, matrices, graphs, finite state machines, Turing machines, and binary
encoding schemes. This course includes Lectures, Coding Exercises, Quizzes, and
Assignments. 

		<h3>Objectives</h3>

		The primary goal of this course is to introduce students to the theoretical concepts, data
structures and algorithms in discrete mathematics in order to establish a theoretical basis for
future study in computing applications and algorithms. Upon successful completion of this
course, the students should be able to demonstrate the following learning outcomes:

		<b>
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
				<li>An understanding of concepts of formal logic such as statements, symbolic
representation, tautologies, propositional logic, and validity.</li>
				<li>An understanding of proof techniques, induction, recursive definitions, and recurrence
relations.</li>
				<li>An understanding of matrix operations.</li>
				<li>An understanding of graphs and trees and their representations.</li>
				<li>An understanding of various graph algorithms.</li>
				<li>An understanding of finite state machines, Turing machines, and formal languages.</li>
				<li>An understanding of various encoding schemes</li>
			</ul>
		</b>

		<h3>Prerequisites and Co-requisites</h3>

		Since there will be programming assignments, students will need a fundamental knowledge of functional
		programming. To that end, students must have completed CSCI 2170 or equivalent with a grade of C (2.0) or better
		prior to taking this course.

		<h2>ASSESSMENT AND GRADING</h2>

		<h3>Grading Procedure</h3>
		Your grade in this class will be calculated based on: Open Lab Assignments (OLA), Tests, Final Exam,
Programming Lab and Attendance.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Open Lab Assignments (OLA)</b></li>
			Open written assignments are designed for the students to solve problems without teacher
supervision. OLAs are graded based upon correctness, and compliance with requirements.
			<li><b>Tests</b></li>
			Two in-class tests will be given. The tests will include questions related to handout materials,
textbook materials, and open lab assignments. 
			<li><b>Final Exam</b></li>
			The final exam is comprehensive. The final exam will include questions related to handout
materials, textbook materials, programming projects, and open lab assignments. 
			<li><b>Programming Lab</b></li>
			It will contain a programming problem that you need to solve by coding and debugging the
programs. Programs are graded based upon design, correctness,
documentation, style, efficiency, and compliance with requirements.
			<li><b>Attendance</b></li>
			Attendance is mandatory. You are expected to attend all classes and to arrive on time. I will take
attendance every day. Your attendance grade is based on your attendance record in D2L.
		</ul>

		<h3>Attendance Reporting</h3>
		Attendance is mandatory. You are expected to attend all classes and to arrive on time. I will take
		attendance every day. Your attendance grade is based on your attendance record in D2L.

		MTSU Administration requires that instructors complete an attendance report for each course each semester. Regular
		class attendance is required and will be monitored by: the D2L system report; participation in the discussion board;
		and timely submission of course assignments. If several class assignment submissions are missing, student attendance
		will be reported as “no longer attending.”
