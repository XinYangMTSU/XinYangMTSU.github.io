		<h2>COURSE INFORMATION</h2>

		<h3>Description</h3>

		This course is a fundamental mathematics course for computer scientists. Topics include formal
logic, proof techniques, matrices, graphs, finite state machines, Turing machines, and binary
encoding schemes. This course includes Lectures, Live Coding Exercises, Quizzes, and
Assignments. 

		<h3>Objectives</h3>

		Upon completion of this course students will be able to:

		<b>
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
				<li>Grasp principal features of the HTTP Protocol.</li>
				<li>Create and publish HTML5 web pages.</li>
				<li>Control web page presentation via Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3).</li>
				<li>Enhance the dynamic and interactive functionality of web pages via client-side scripting with JavaScript.
				</li>
				<li>Use the Document Object Model (DOM) to access and modify the contents of a page dynamically using
					event-driven
					JavaScript.</li>
				<li>Grasp web server functionality.</li>
				<li>Use the server side scripting language (PHP) to create dynamic web pages.</li>
				<li>Connect to a database (MySQL).</li>
			</ul>
		</b>

		<h3>Prerequisites and Co-requisites</h3>

		Since there will be programming assignments, students will need a fundamental knowledge of functional
		programming. To that end, students must have completed CSCI 2170 or equivalent with a grade of C (2.0) or better
		prior to taking this course.

		<h3>COURSE MATERIALS</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Textbook is not required.</li>
			<li>Course material can be found from Course Calendar: <a href="https://lecture.yangxinmtsu.repl.co/4410.html"
					target="_">https://lecture.yangxinmtsu.repl.co/4410.html</a>. To successfully complete
				this course, it is your responsibility to read all the course material in Course Calendar each week.</li>
			<li>The D2L course management system will be used to post grades for this class.</li>

		<h2>ASSESSMENT AND GRADING</h2>

		<h3>Grading Procedure</h3>
		Your grade in this class will be calculated based on: Open Lab Assignments (OLA), Tests, Project, Attendance and
		Final Exam.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Open Lab Assignments (OLA)</b></li>
			Open assignments are designed for the students to solve problems without teacher supervision. Programs are graded
			based upon design, correctness, documentation, style, efficiency, and compliance with requirements.
			<li><b>Tests</b></li>
			Two in-class tests will be given. The tests will include questions related to handout materials, and open lab
			assignments. Each test will contain a programming problem that you need to solve by coding
			and debugging the programs during the test time.
			<li><b>Final Exam</b></li>
			The final exam is comprehensive. The final exam will include questions related to handout materials, and open lab
			assignments. It will contain a programming problem that you need
			to solve by coding and debugging the programs during the test time.
			<li><b>Project/Presentation</b></li>
			There will be a group project with a presentation.
			<li><b>Attendance</b></li>
			Attendance is mandatory. You are expected to attend all classes and to arrive on time.
		</ul>

		<h3>Attendance Reporting</h3>
		Attendance is mandatory. You are expected to attend all classes and to arrive on time. I will take
		attendance every day. Your attendance grade is based on your attendance record in D2L.

		MTSU Administration requires that instructors complete an attendance report for each course each semester. Regular
		class attendance is required and will be monitored by: the D2L system report; participation in the discussion board;
		and timely submission of course assignments. If several class assignment submissions are missing, student attendance
		will be reported as “no longer attending.”
