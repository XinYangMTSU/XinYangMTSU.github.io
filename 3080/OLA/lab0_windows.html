<B>BACKGROUND:</B>
The computer system you will use in CSCI 3080 for programming
is named <B><i>ranger</i></B>.
(Actually, <i>ranger</i> is an umbrella name for several actual machines,
such as <i>ranger0</i> or <i>ranger1</i>.  Because it doesn't matter which
particular ranger machine you are using, we'll just say <i>ranger</i>.)
&nbsp;
<I>Ranger</I> runs the UNIX operating system,
an extremely powerful and popular system.
There are different "dialects" of UNIX,
such as <I>Mac OS X</I> or <I>HP-UX</I>.
The UNIX dialect running on ranger is called <B><I>Linux</I></B>.

<P>
Unlike a small personal computer that you physically handle to use,
<I>ranger</I> is a server that we will use via a network connection.
In CSCI 3080 each user is given an account, uniquely identified by
a <I>C-number</I>, that will be used when connecting to <I>ranger</I>.
Your work will be done while logged in to that course account.
Because your files are stored under your
course account on <I>ranger</I>, it doesn't matter where you are or
what computer you're using to connect to <I>ranger</I>, your files
will always be available to you.
In this lab,
you will do a one-time customization of your course computer account
to get it ready for the rest of the semester.

DIRECTIONS:  Follow the instructions and
perform the actions indicated as they appear in the text.
</FONT>
<!--
(This is <I>different</I> from standard closed labs where you only do
something when it is inside an exercise.)
-->
<BR>
To do this lab, you will first need to have been given your
<I>C-number</I> (and corresponding <I>password</I>)
by your course instructor.
<br>
<h2>Step 0: Download and Install <font color="#0080ff">MobaXterm</font></h2>
You can download the latest version of MobaXterm from:
<a href="http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html" target="_blank">http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html</a>
<br>
You should select the <b>MobaXterm Home Edition (Portable Edition)</b>: 
<Br>
<Br>
	<center>
	<img src="../../images/MobaXterm_download.png" width="400px" height="100px">
	</center>
	<br>
After unzipping the downloaded file you will have an executable .exe file. Double click it. <br>
Please skip Step 0 if MobaXterm is already installed on your computer.

<BR><h2>Step 1: LOG IN USING <FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="blue">MobaXterm</FONT></h2>
To connect to the <I>ranger</I> server from your personal Microsoft Windows computer, you will need to use a program known as a
<B><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="blue">MobaXterm</FONT></B>
<IMG SRC="../../images/MobaXterm_Icon.jpeg" width="4%" ALT="MobaXterm icon">
<BR>
Locate the <FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="blue"><B>MobaXterm</B></FONT>
icon on your mac.
<BR>
Double-click the <FONT COLOR="blue"><B>MobaXterm</B></FONT> icon
to activate the app.
<BR>
<P>
You will then see a window like the following. Please click the <b>Session</b> Icon in the uppser left corner to start a new Session.
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../../images/MobaXterm.png" ALT="MobaXterm icon" WIDTH="60%">
</CENTER>
<br>

You will see a window like the following after you click the <b>Session</b> Icon.
Then click the <b>SSH</b> Icon in the uppser left corner and press the <b>OK</b> button.
<br>
<br>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../../images/MobaXterm_Session.png" ALT="MobaXterm prompt" WIDTH="60%">
</CENTER>
<br>
Now, you will see a window like the following. Please enter <b><font color="red">ranger.cs.mtsu.edu</font></b> in the field of Remote host, please make sure the <b><font color="red">Port number is 22</font></b>, then press <b>OK</b> button.
<br>
<br>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../../images/MobaXterm_SSH.png" ALT="MobaXterm prompt" WIDTH="60%">
</CENTER>
<Br>
Then, you will see a log in window like the following:
<br>
<br>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../../images/MobaXterm_Login.png" ALT="MobaXterm prompt" WIDTH="60%">
</CENTER>
<P>
Use your <I>course account</I> information to access <I>ranger</I>.  
At the <FONT SIZE="+1"><tt>login as:</tt></FONT> prompt,
enter your course account's <I>C-number</I>
(that is, the 8&nbsp;character login <I>username</I> you were assigned;
for example, c8294612).
<br>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../../images/MobaXterm_Login2.png" ALT="MobaXterm prompt" WIDTH="60%">
</CENTER>

When prompted for a <FONT SIZE="+1"><tt>Password:</tt></FONT>,
enter your course account's <I>password</I>; for example 74aB2w45.
Your password will not be displayed
so be careful in your typing; 
hit the enter key when you are done typing the password.
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="green">
NOTE:
UNIX is <I>case-sensitive</I>,
that is, it distinguishes between upper and lower case letters.
It is important to type the information exactly as indicated.
</FONT>
<br>
<br>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../../images/MobaXterm_Login3.png" ALT="MobaXterm prompt" WIDTH="60%">
</CENTER>
<Br>
Then, you will get a pop up window, Do you want to save pasword for your c-number, please hit <B>No</B> button:
<br>
<br>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../../images/MobaXterm_Login4.png" ALT="MobaXterm prompt" WIDTH="60%">
</CENTER>
<P>
<I>
<B>If you entered something wrong,</B> you will get an error message:
</I>
<BR><TT>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Access denied
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Keyboard-interactive authentication prompts from server:
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Password:
</TT>
<BR>
<I>
If you typed the password wrong, you will be able to re-enter
the password information.

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../../images/MobaXterm_Wrong.png" ALT="MobaXterm prompt" WIDTH="60%">
</CENTER>

However if you entered the username (<I>C-number</I>) incorrectly
you must start over, you can close the Session by click the cross sign highlighted by the red rectangle.
If you are unsuccessful after several attempts,
check to be sure the <b>Caps Lock</b> key is not locked 
on the keyboard. If it is, unlock it and try again.
Otherwise, ask the lab assistant for help.
</I>

<P>
Once you successfully login to the server, you will see something like:

<h2>Step 2: CUSTOMIZE YOUR ACCOUNT:</h2>
<BR>
Much of UNIX is "command&nbsp;driven"; that's a fancy way of saying
that to get most things done, you type out command instructions 
inside a <I>Terminal</I> window instead of clicking on icons.
(Another term for this is that you're using a <B>CLI</B> or
<B>C</B>ommand <B>L</B>ine <B>I</B>nterface.)
Recall that UNIX is <I>case-sensitive</I> and thus
distinguishes between upper and lower case letters.
It is important to type the commands exactly as indicated.
Failing to put in a space where required is an error; however
when a space is required, the amount of space (i.e., the number of blanks)
is usually not critical.

The Computer Science department has created software that will
customize your account so that it is suitable to use for this course.
The following customization should only be done once.
You will <b>never</b> need to customize this account again.

<P>
The general form of the customization command is as follows:
<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT>&nbsp;
<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue>~cs/customize 3080 
      <SELECT NAME="teachers">
        <option selected> Select teacher's userid. 
  <option> sbarbosa
  <option> rbutler
  <option> zdong
  <option> yigu
  <option> cen
  <option selected> xyang
  <option> pettey
  <option> jphillips
  <option> msarkar
  <option> sseo
  <option> untch
      </select>
</FONT>
</FONT>
</CENTER>
<BR>
With your mouse, 
click on the arrow next to "Select teacher's userid." and highlight 
the appropriate userid (your lab instructor will tell you which one).
The command above should now have your teacher's userid on the end of the line.

<OL>
<LI>
In the <I>MobaXterm Terminal</I> window, at the <FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT> prompt,
enter the customize line exactly as shown above.
(Do NOT enter the dollar sign as part of your
command. It is meant to represent the prompt provided by the system.) 

<P>
As an example, if you have CSCI <FONT COLOR="red">3080</FONT>
with Dr. <FONT COLOR="blue">Xin Yang</FONT>
your entry would look like:
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../images/MobaXterm_Customize.png" ALT="MobaXterm customize" WIDTH="60%">
<BR>
</CENTER>

<P>
<LI>
   The customization will ask you for your first (personal/nickname)
   name and last (family) name.  Use mixed-case in entering your names;
   for example, enter "John" and not "john" or "JOHN". 
</P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../images/MobaXterm_FirstName.png" ALT="MobaXterm customize" WIDTH="60%">
<BR>
</CENTER>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../images/MobaXterm_LastName.png" ALT="MobaXterm customize" WIDTH="60%">
<BR>
</CENTER>

<p>
   Next you will
   be asked for your PipelineMT user name.  (You will NOT be asked
   for your PipelineMT password.)  
</p> 

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../images/MobaXterm_Pipeline.png" ALT="MobaXterm customize" WIDTH="60%">
<BR>
</CENTER>

<P>Lastly you must enter the 3-digit course section number <b><font color="red">(001)</font></b>. 
Please double check your 3-digit course section number before you enter.</P>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../images/MobaXterm_Section.png" ALT="MobaXterm customize" WIDTH="60%">
<BR>
</CENTER>

<P>
<LI>
   If there are any errors, please review what you have done and
   start over at step 1.
   Otherwise, exit the terminal window by typing
   <FONT COLOR="blue" SIZE="+1"><TT>exit</TT></FONT>.

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../images/MobaXterm_Exit.png" ALT="MobaXterm customize" WIDTH="60%">
<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>
	Now you can open up a new <I>Session Terminal</I> window by clicking <b>ranger.cs.mtsu.edu</b> on the left panel. Please log in ranger with your C-number and  password again.

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../images/MobaXterm_Restart.png" ALT="MobaXterm confirmation" WIDTH="60%">
</CENTER>
<br>

Once log in successful, it should be similar to:
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../images/MobaXterm_Success.png" ALT="MobaXterm confirmation" WIDTH="60%">
</CENTER>
   with CSCI 3080 Notices appearing (highlighted by red arrow)
   and a prompt now of the form "ranger$" (Don't worry about which
   ranger number is being displayed.)
   If your screen has these items, everything is OK.
   If not, please check with the instructor as to what might have gone wrong.
<P>
Next enter the following UNIX command:
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<FONT COLOR="red">$</FONT> <FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue><B>handin</B></FONT>
     <BR>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../images/MobaXterm_handin.png" ALT="handin" WIDTH="60%">
<BR>
</CENTER>
Because this is the first time you are using the
<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue><B>handin</B></FONT>
command, you will get a message of the form:
<PRE>
NOTE: Please enter your course account's password when prompted.
(Use your instructor-supplied course account password.)
Authentication realm: &lt;svn://svn.cs.mtsu.edu:3690&gt; 076fc91e-5327-0410-80b2-9ad2079b72ac
Password for 'c*******':
</PRE>
Enter your course account password (the same one you used to log on to ranger)
as indicated.
<FONT COLOR="green">
&nbsp;
Usually, your password will be obscured by a row of asterisks.
However on one of the ranger systems,
don't be alarmed that nothing seems to be being entered;
your password will <b>not</b> be shown on the screen as you type it,
not even as a row of asterisks.  It is going in, however!
</FONT>
<BR> 
(You may also be asked if you'd like to
<CODE>Store&nbsp;password&nbsp;unencrypted&nbsp;(yes/no)?</CODE>;
&nbsp;
if asked, answer &nbsp;
<FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue>
<B><CODE>yes</CODE></B></FONT>.)
<BR> 
This will be the only time you will need to provide
this information for <FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue><B>handin</B></FONT>;
the information is stored for future uses.
<BR> 
If successful, this <FONT FACE="Verdana" COLOR=blue><B>handin</B></FONT>
command will display a list of current valid assignment identification codes.
You can safely ignore what this list contains for the time being.

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="../images/MobaXterm_handin_done.png" ALT="handin" WIDTH="60%">
<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<LI>
<B>LOG OFF:</B>
Once you are done, you will need to log off <I>ranger</I>
by entering
<FONT COLOR="blue" SIZE="+1"><TT>exit</TT></FONT>
at the command-line.
