	<h1>What is Dijkstra’s Algorithm?</h1>

	Dijkstra’s algorithm is also known as the shortest path algorithm. It is an algorithm used to find the shortest path
	between nodes of the graph. The algorithm creates the tree of the shortest paths from the starting source vertex from
	all other points in the graph. It differs from the minimum spanning tree as the shortest distance between two vertices
	may not be included in all the vertices of the graph. The algorithm works by building a set of nodes that have a
	minimum distance from the source. Here, Dijkstra's algorithm uses a greedy approach to solve the problem and find the
	best solution.

	<h1>Algorithm for Dijkstra’s in C++</h1>

	To know how Dijkstra's algorithm works behind the scene, look at the below steps to understand it in detail:

	<ol>
		<li>First of all, we will mark all vertex as unvisited vertex </li>
		<li>Then, we will mark the source vertex as 0 and all other vertices as infinity</li>
		<li>Consider source vertex as current vertex</li>
		<li>Calculate the path length of all the neighboring vertex from the current vertex by adding the weight of the edge
			in the current vertex</li>
		<li>Now, if the new path length is smaller than the previous path length then replace it otherwise ignore it</li>
		<li>Mark the current vertex as visited after visiting the neighbor vertex of the current vertex</li>
		<li>Select the vertex with the smallest path length as the new current vertex and go back to step 4.</li>
		<li>Repeat this process until all the vertex are marked as visited.</li>
	</ol>

	Once we go through the algorithm, we can backtrack the source vertex and find our shortest path.
