		Complexity theory is like a way of understanding how hard or easy it is to solve different problems using computers.
		And Turing Machines are like special machines that help us study and measure the difficulty of these problems.

		Imagine you have a bunch of puzzles, and you want to know how long it will take to solve each puzzle. The Turing
		Machine is like a magical puzzle-solving machine that can try to solve any puzzle you give it. It follows specific
		rules and steps to solve the puzzle.

		Now, some puzzles are easy and can be solved quickly by the Turing Machine. These puzzles belong to a group called
		"P." It's like solving a jigsaw puzzle with a few pieces. The pieces fit together nicely, and you can quickly find
		the right places for them.

		But then there are puzzles that are much harder to solve. These belong to a group called "NP." It's like solving a
		huge maze with many different paths. It's challenging to find the right way out, and it may take a long time to
		solve.

		The interesting thing is that while the Turing Machine can try to solve these harder puzzles, it might take a very
		long time to find the solution. We don't know if there's a quick and efficient way to solve all puzzles in the NP
		group, or if it will always take a long time.

		So, Complexity Theory helps us understand and classify problems based on how hard they are to solve. Turing Machines
		provide the foundation for this theory by being a model that helps us measure the difficulty of problems and
		determine which problems can be solved quickly and which ones are more challenging.

		By studying Complexity Theory and Turing Machines, we can learn about the limits and possibilities of solving
		problems using computers, which is important for designing efficient algorithms and understanding what can and
		cannot be done in computer science.

		Turing Machines provide a way to measure the difficulty of problems by analyzing the resources required to solve
		them. These resources include time and space.

		Time Complexity: Turing Machines help us understand how long it takes to solve a problem. We measure this as time
		complexity. It tells us the number of steps or operations the Turing Machine needs to perform to find the solution.
		Problems that can be solved quickly by a Turing Machine are said to have a low time complexity, while problems that
		require a lot of steps have a high time complexity.

		Space Complexity: Turing Machines also help us understand how much memory or space is needed to solve a problem. We
		measure this as space complexity. It tells us how much memory the Turing Machine needs to store and manipulate data
		while solving the problem. Problems that can be solved with a small amount of memory have a low space complexity,
		while problems that require a lot of memory have a high space complexity.

		By studying the behavior of Turing Machines, we can analyze the time and space complexity of different problems.
		This analysis helps us determine which problems can be solved quickly and which ones are more challenging. We can
		classify problems into different complexity classes based on their time and space requirements.

		For example:

		Problems in the class P (Polynomial Time) can be solved efficiently by a Turing Machine in a reasonable amount of
		time. These problems have a low time complexity.

		Problems in the class NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time) are more challenging. It means that if we are given a
		possible solution, we can quickly verify if it is correct. However, finding the solution itself may take a long
		time. These problems have a high time complexity.

		There are other complexity classes as well, such as NP-complete and NP-hard, which represent some of the most
		difficult problems to solve efficiently.

		Turing Machines provide a reference model that allows us to study and compare the time and space requirements of
		different problems. This helps us understand the difficulty of problems and design algorithms that can efficiently
		solve them. It also helps us identify problems that may be inherently difficult and have no known efficient solutio

		Implementing Turing Machines to directly measure the time complexity of a problem can be challenging because Turing
		Machines are an abstract theoretical model rather than a practical programming language. However, we can use the
		theoretical concepts derived from Turing Machines to estimate or analyze the time complexity of a problem. Here's a
		high-level approach:

		Define the Problem: Clearly define the problem you want to analyze in terms of inputs, outputs, and the desired
		solution. Understand the problem's requirements, constraints, and any assumptions.

		Design an Algorithm: Design an algorithm that solves the problem. This algorithm should be based on the rules and
		behaviors of Turing Machines. Break down the problem into smaller steps and define the operations needed to solve
		each step.

		Analyze the Algorithm: Analyze the algorithm to estimate its time complexity. This can be done by counting the
		number of steps or operations required for each step of the algorithm. Identify any loops or repetitive operations
		that may affect the overall time complexity.

		Express the Time Complexity: Express the time complexity using Big O notation or other relevant complexity
		notations. This notation describes how the time requirements of the algorithm grow as the input size increases. For
		example, O(n) represents linear time complexity, O(n^2) represents quadratic time complexity, and so on.

		Validate and Verify: To validate the estimated time complexity, you can run the algorithm on different input sizes
		and measure the time it takes to solve the problem. Compare the observed running times with the estimated time
		complexity and check if they align.
		<br>
		It's important to note that directly implementing a Turing Machine as a practical program to measure time complexity
		is not common. Instead, the theoretical concepts derived from Turing Machines, such as the steps outlined above, are
		used to reason about and estimate the time complexity of algorithms.

		In practice, programming languages and tools provide built-in functions or libraries that offer time complexity
		analysis. These tools can automatically measure the running time of algorithms on various inputs and provide
		insights into their time complexity.

		While Turing Machines may not be directly implementable as practical programs, they serve as a theoretical model
		that helps us reason about computation. Here's an analogy that might help clarify:

		Think of a map as a model of a city. A map provides a representation of the city's layout, roads, landmarks, and
		helps us understand and navigate the city. However, the map itself is not the physical cityâ€”it's a simplified
		representation that helps us make sense of the real-world city.

		Similarly, Turing Machines are like a theoretical model or a "map" of computation. They help us understand the
		fundamental concepts and principles of computation, such as algorithms, decision-making, and problem-solving. While
		we may not directly implement Turing Machines in practical programming, they provide a simplified representation
		that helps us reason about computation and analyze the behavior of algorithms.

		By using Turing Machines as a theoretical framework, we can define different complexity classes, such as P, NP, and
		others, which classify problems based on their computational difficulty. These complexity classes help us understand
		the limitations and possibilities of solving problems algorithmically.

		So, even though Turing Machines may not have a direct physical implementation, they provide an abstract and powerful
		tool for studying computation and complexity. They serve as a foundation for understanding what can and cannot be
		computed, and they allow us to reason about the efficiency and difficulty of solving problems using algorithms.

		The Halting Problem is like trying to predict whether a machine will ever stop or keep going forever. Imagine you
		have a special machine that takes in a list of instructions and some input. You want to know if this machine will
		eventually finish its task or if it will keep going on and on without stopping.

		The problem is that there is no magical rule or trick that can tell you for sure what the machine will do. Even the
		smartest computer scientists have proven that there is no way to create a program that can predict with certainty
		whether any machine will stop or not.

		This means that there are some puzzles that are just too tricky to solve using a computer. The Halting Problem shows
		us that there are limits to what computers can figure out, no matter how clever we are.

		a Turing Machine cannot solve all problems. While Turing Machines are powerful theoretical models of computation,
		there are certain problems that are mathematically proven to be unsolvable or undecidable, meaning that no algorithm
		or Turing Machine can provide a definite answer for all possible inputs.

		The most famous example of an unsolvable problem is the Halting Problem, which asks whether a given Turing Machine
		will halt or run forever on a specific input. It has been mathematically proven that there is no algorithm or Turing
		Machine that can solve the Halting Problem for all cases.

		Moreover, there are problems that fall into the category of "computationally infeasible," where solving them using a
		Turing Machine would require an impractical amount of time or resources. These problems may have solutions, but the
		time complexity of finding those solutions may be so high that they are not feasible to compute within a reasonable
		time frame.

		Therefore, while Turing Machines are powerful models of computation, they have limitations. Some problems are
		unsolvable, some are computationally infeasible, and some problems can be efficiently solved using algorithms
		running on Turing Machines. The field of computational complexity theory explores the boundaries and classifications
		of problems based on their solvability and computational difficulty.

		<br><br>
		Since a Turing Machine can simulate any algorithm executed on a computer, any problem that can be solved by a
		computer can also be solved by a Turing Machine. If a problem is computable by a common computer, it means that
		there exists an algorithm that can solve it, and that algorithm can be simulated by a Turing Machine.
