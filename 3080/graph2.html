		<h1>Chapter 6: Graphs and Trees</h1>

		<center>
			<h2>Section 6.1 Graphs and Their Representations</h2>
		</center>

		<br>
		<br>
		Graphs are a fundamental concept in discrete mathematics, used to model relationships between objects. 
		This section introduces key graph terminology, types of graphs, and their real-world applications.

		<h1>Graph Terminology</h1>
		Graphs are formal mathematical representations of networks, collections of objects, events,
		or set elements that lead naturally from one to another.

		<br>
		<br>

		Before proceeding, we need some terminology about graphs. Surprisingly, although there is a large body of
		literature in graph theory, the terminology is not completely standard. Therefore other books may give slightly
		different variations of some of these terms.

		<h2>Adjacent Vertices</h2>
		Two vertices are said to be <b>
			<font color="blue">adjacent</font>
		</b> if there is an edge(arc) connecting them. <br>
		<center>
			<img width="400px" height="200px" src="images/adjVertex1.png">
			<br>
			<caption><a href="https://slideplayer.com/slide/6918692/" target="_blank">source</a></caption>
		</center>

		<h2>Adjacent Edges</h2>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">Adjacent edges</font>
		</b> are edges that share a common vertex.<br>
		<center>
			<img width="400px" height="200px" src="images/adjacentEdge.png">
			<br>
			<caption><a href="https://slideplayer.com/slide/6918692/" target="_blank"></a></caption>
		</center>
		(1) Edge (A,C) and (A,D) are adjacent edges, they share a common vertex: A. <br>
		(2) Edge (A,C) and (B,D) are not adjacent edges, they don't have common vertex. <Br>

		<h2>Loop</h2>
		A <b>
			<font color="blue">loop</font>
		</b> is an edge that connects a vertex to itself. A graph
		with no loops is <b>
			<font color="blue">loop free</font>
		</b>. <br>
		<Br>
		<center>
			<img width="300px" height="200px" src="images/loop.png">
			<br>
			<caption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_(graph_theory)" target="_blank">A graph with a loop on vertex
					1</a></caption>
		</center>

		<h3>Application in Real-World of Loop:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Self-Loops in Social Networks:</b> On social media platforms like Twitter, a user might retweet their own tweet or interact with their own posts (like, comment, or share). 
				This can be thought of as a loop in a social network graph, where a user (vertex) interacts with themselves (edge connecting back to the same vertex).</li>
			
			<li><b>Personal Communication:</b> In a social graph, a loop could represent an individual calling or texting their own number (e.g., testing a phone system) or sending an email to themselves.
</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Parallel Arcs</h2>
		Two arcs with the same endpoints are <b>
			<font color="blue">parallel arcs</font>
		</b>. Parallel arcs share the same pair of start and end vertices. <br>
		<center>
			<img width="300px" height="200px" src="images/parallel.jpeg">
			<br>
			<caption><a href="" target="_blank"></a></caption>
		</center>
		
		<h3>Application in Real-World of Parallel Arcs:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Flight Routes:</b> In airline networks, parallel arcs can represent multiple airlines operating flights between the same two airports. For example, if both Delta and American Airlines offer flights between JFK and LAX, 
				the two flight routes form parallel arcs in the network.</li>
			<li><b>Electrical Circuits:</b> In circuit design, parallel wires connecting the same two components (like resistors, capacitors, or power sources) create parallel arcs, 
				offering multiple paths for current to flow.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Simple Graph</h2>
		A <b>
			<font color="blue">simple graph</font>
		</b> is an <font color="red"><b>unweighted</b></font>, <font color="red"><b>undirected</b></font> graph that does not have more than one edge between any two vertices and no edge
		starts and ends at the same vertex. In other words, a simple graph is a graph <font color="red"><b>without loops</b></font> and <font color="red"><b>without parallel arcs</b></font>. <br>
		<center>
			<img width="300px" height="200px" src="images/simpleGraph.png">
		</center>

		<ul>
			<li>✅ Unweighted</li>	
			<li>✅ Undirected</li>
			<li>✅ No Loops</li>
			<li>✅ No Parallel Arcs</li>
		</ul>
		If a graph meets all four conditions, it is considered a simple graph.
		<br>
		
		<h2>Isolated Node</h2>
		An <b>
			<font color="blue">isolated node</font>
		</b> is adjacent to no other node. <br>
		<Br>
		<center>
			<img width="300px" height="200px" src="images/isolated.png">
		</center>

		<h3>Real-World Examples:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Disconnected House: </b> A house that has been disconnected from the power grid due to an outage or maintenance would be an isolated node in the power distribution network.</li>
			<li><b>Offline Security Camera:</b> A security camera that is part of a smart home system but currently offline or unconnected to the home network would be an isolated node in the security network.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Degree of a Vertex</h2>
		The <b>
			<font color="blue">degree</font>
		</b> of a vertex is the number of arcs incident with that vertex. <br>
		<Br>
		<center>
			<img width="300px" height="200px" src="images/degree.png">
		</center>

		<ul>
			<li>For an undirected graph, the degree of a vertex is equal to the number of adjacent vertices.</li>
			<Li>A special case is a loop, which <font color="red"><b>adds two</b></font> to the degree. This can be understood by letting each connection of the loop edge count as its own adjacent vertex.</Li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Complete Graph</h2>
		A <b>
			<font color="blue">complete graph</font>
		</b> is a <b>
			<font color="blue">simple undirected graph</font>
		</b> in which each pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.<br>
		<br>
		Complete graphs on \(n\) vertices, for \(n\) between 1 and 12, are shown below along with the numbers of edges: <Br>
		<center>
			<img width="500px" height="400px" src="images/completeGraph.png">
			<br>
			<caption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph" target="_blank">Complete Graphs on \(n\)
					vertices</a></caption>
		</center>

		<ul>
			<li><b>All Vertices Connected:</b> In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex by a single edge. There are no missing connections.</li>
			<li><b>No Parallel Edges or Loops</b></li>
			<li><b>Maximum Number of Edges: </b> A complete graph contains the maximum possible number of edges for a given number of vertices.</li>
			
		</ul>

		The formula for the total number of edges in a complete graph \(K_n\) is given by: <br>
		\(
			E(n) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
		\)
		where: <br> 
		<ul>
			<li><b>\(E(n)\)</b> is the number of edges in the graph.</li>
			<li><b>\(n\)</b> is the number of vertices in the graph.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<br>

		<h2>Path</h2>
		A <b>
			<font color="blue">path</font>
		</b> in a graph represents a way to get from an origin to
		a destination by traversing edges in the graph. For example, in the undirected graph G = (V,E) drawn below, there
		are many paths from node 6 to node 1. One such path is highlighted with red: <br>

		<center>
			<img width="300px" height="200px" src="images/path1.png">
		</center>

		The red path above is {{6,4}, {4,3}, {3,2}, {2,5}, {5,1}}; it is a path in G from node 6 to node 1. <br><Br>

		<center>
			<img width="300px" height="200px" src="images/path2.png">
		</center>

		The blue path above is {{6,4}, {4,5}, {5,1}}; it is also a path in G from node 6 to node 1. <br><Br>


		A <b>
			<font color="blue">path</font>
		</b> is a sequence of vertices with the property that each vertex in the sequence is adjacent to the vertex next to
		it. A path that does not repeat vertices is called a <b>
			<font color="blue">simple path</font>
		</b>. A <b>
			<font color="blue">path</font>
		</b> from node \(n_0\) to node \(n_k\) is a sequence \(n_0, a_0, n_1, a_1, \dots, n_{k-1}, a_{k-1}, n_{k}\) of nodes
		and arcs where for each \(i\), the endpoints of arc \(a_i\) are \(n_i - n_{i+1}\) <br>

		<h2>Length of a Path</h2>
		The <b>
			<font color="blue">length</font>
		</b> of a path is the number of arcs it contains; if an arc is used more than once, it is counted each time it is
		used. <br>

		<h2>Connected Graph</h2>
		A graph is <b>
			<font color="blue">connected</font>
		</b> if there is a path from any node to any other node. <Br>
		<center>
			<img width="400px" height="300px" src="images/connectedGraph.gif">
		</center>

		<h3>Applications of Connected Graphs:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Networking:</b> In computer and communication networks, a connected graph ensures that every device (node) can communicate with every other device.</li>
			<li><b>Transportation Systems:</b> Road networks are modeled as connected graphs to ensure that all locations can be reached from any starting point.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Cycle</h2>
		A <b>
			<font color="blue">cycle</font>
		</b> in a graph is a path from some node \(v_0\) back to \(v_0\) where no arc appears more than once in the path
		sequence, \(v_0\) is the only node appearing more than once, and \(v_0\) occurs only at the ends. A graph with no
		cycles is <b>
			<font color="blue">acyclic</font>
		</b>.<br>

		<center>
			<img width="300px" height="200px" src="images/cycle.png">
		</center>

		
		A Cycle is a closed path. Formally, a cycle is a sequence of edges: \((v_0,v_1 ),(v_1,v_2), ..., (v_{n-1},v_n),(v_n,v_0) \), where:
		<ul>
			<li>\(v_0, v_1, ..., v_n\) are vertices in the graph.</li>
			<li>Each consecutive pair of vertices \((v_i,v_{i+1})\) is connected by an edge in the graph.</li>
			<li>The path forms a loop, meaning it starts and ends at the same vertex:\(v_0 = v_n\)</li>
			<li>No other vertex repeats within the sequence except for the start and end vertex.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<br>

		<h2>Bipartite Complete Graph</h2>
		A graph is a <b>
			<font color="blue">bipartite complete graph</font>
		</b> if its nodes can be partitioned into two disjoint nonempty
		sets \(N_1\) and \(N_2\) such that two nodes \(x\) and \(y\) are adjacent if and only if \(x &isin; N_1\) and \(y
		&isin; N_2\). If \(|N_1| = m\) and \(|N_2| = n\), such a graph is denoted by \(K_{m,n}\). It is a special kind of
		bipartite graph where every vertex to the first set is connected to every vertex of the second set. <br>

		In such a graph, every vertex from one set is connected to every vertex from the other set, 
		but there are no edges between vertices within the same set.
		<br>

		<center>
			<img width="300px" height="200px" src="images/bipartite.png">
			<br>
			<caption>An example of bipartite complete graph</caption>
		</center>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Two Disjoint Sets:</b>The graph is bipartite, meaning its vertex set can be divided into two disjoint sets</li> 
			<li><b>Complete:</b>In a bipartite complete graph, every vertex in set \(N_1\) is connected to every vertex in \(N_2\).</li>
		</ul>

		A <b>bipartite complete graph</b> is a mathematical model or abstraction used to represent relationships between two distinct sets of entities.
		
		<h3>Real-world application for Bipartite Complete Graph</h3>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Airport Networks:</b> In an international airline system, one set can represent airports in country A, and another set can represent airports in country B. 
			In a bipartite complete graph model, every airport in country A has a direct flight to every airport in country B, 
			maximizing connectivity between the two regions.</li>
				<li><b>Processor-Core Communication:</b> In parallel computing, if every processor in a set needs to communicate with every core in another set, 
					this interaction can be modeled as a bipartite complete graph. This ensures complete communication between the processors and cores, 
					improving task allocation.</li>
			</ul>
			

		<h2>Isomorphism Graphs</h2>
		An <b>
			<font color="blue">isomorphic graphs</font>
		</b> G and H is a bijection between the vertex sets of G and H. <br>
		\(f: V(G) &rarr; V(H) \) <br>
		such that any two vertices \(u\) and \(v\) of G are adjacent in G if and only if \(f(u)\) and \(f(v)\) are adjacent
		in H. This kind of bijection is commonly described as "edge-preserving bijection", in accordance with the general
		notion of isomorphism being a structrue-perserving bijection. <br>
		<br>
		Two graphs \(G_1 = (V_1, E_1)\) and \(G_2 = (V_2, E_2)\) are <b>isomorphic</b> if there is a <b>one-to-one correspondence</b> (or mapping) between their vertex sets and edge sets.
		<center>
			<img height="300px" width="500px" src="images/isomorphic.png">
			<br>
			<caption><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></caption>
		</center>
		<br>
		<b>Isomorphism graphs</b> refers to a concept in graph theory where two graphs are considered isomorphic if they are structurally identical, 
		even though their vertex and edge labels might differ.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Same number of vertices:</b> Both graphs must have the same number of vertices.</li>
			<li><b>Same number of edges:</b> Both graphs must have the same number of edges.</li>
			<li><b>Preservation of adjacency:</b> If two vertices are connected by an edge in one graph, 
				their corresponding vertices in the other graph must also be connected.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How can we check if two graphs are isomorphic?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1. Compare the Number of Vertices and Edges</li>
			Count the number of vertices and edges in both graphs.<br>
			If the number of vertices or edges is different, the graphs are <b>not isomorphic</b>.
			<li>2. Compare the Degree of Each Vertex</li>
			For each graph, calculate the degree of each vertex.<br>
			If the degree sequences (the list of vertex degrees) are not the same in both graphs, they are <b>not isomorphic</b>.
			<li>3. Compare Neighborhoods</li>
			Compare the local neighborhoods of vertices. <br>
			If a vertex in one graph is connected to a set of vertices, the corresponding vertex in the other graph must have the same neighborhood structure.
			<li>4. Use algorithms for larger graphs.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Graph Isomorphism in Real-World Applications:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Pattern Recognition:</b> Isomorphism is used in computer vision and pattern recognition to determine 
				if two objects or structures are the same under relabeling or rotation.</li>
			<li><b>Chemical Structures:</b> In chemistry, graph isomorphism helps in identifying whether two molecular structures (represented as graphs) 
				are identical, regardless of atom labeling.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<br>
