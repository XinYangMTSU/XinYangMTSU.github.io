		<h1>Download & Install C++ Compiler</h1>

    
		<h2>Macs</h2>
		Installing a C++ compiler on macOS is straightforward since macOS comes with built-in tools for development. 
		The most common way to install a C++ compiler on a Mac is through <b>Xcode Command Line Tools</b>, 
		which includes g++ (via clang++) for compiling C++ code. 
		<br>
		The Xcode Command Line Tools package includes the clang compiler, which is a front-end for C, C++, and Objective-C. This is sufficient for most C++ development on macOS.
		
		Steps to Install Xcode Command Line Tools:
		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; 1. Open Terminal: </li>
			
      			(1) Press <b>Cmd + Space</b> to open Spotlight.
			<br>
      			(2) Type <b>Terminal</b> and press <b>Enter</b> to open it.
      		<br><br>
      <li>&#9733; 2. In the Terminal, type the following command and press Enter: </li>
	
			<b>xcode-select --install</b>
			<br>
		<br>
		<li>&#9733; 3. Confirm Installation:</li>
			(1) A pop-up window will appear asking if you want to install the tools. Click <b>Install</b>.
			<br>
			(2) Agree to the terms and conditions, and the installation process will begin. 
			This might take a few minutes, depending on your internet speed.
		<br>	
		<li>&#9733; 4. Verify the Installation</li>
		Verify that clang (the C++ compiler) is installed by running the following command in Terminal:
		<br>
			<b>clang --version</b>
		<br>
		<br>
			You should see the version of the installed compiler.
		</ul>
