		<h1>Induction</h1>
		<h2>The ideas behind induction</h2>

		There is one final proof technique especially useful in computer science.
		To illustrate how the technique works, imagine that you are climbing an infinitely high ladder. How do you know
		whether you will be able to reach an arbitrarily high rung? Suppose we make the following two assertions about your
		climbing abilities. <br>
		<br>
		1. You can reach the first rung. <br>
		2. Once you get to a rung, you can always climb to the next one up. (Notice that this assertion is an implication)
		<br>
		<br>
		If both statement 1 and the implication of statement 2 are true, then by statement 1 you can get to the first rung
		and therefore by statement 2 you can get to the second; by statement 2 again, you can get to the third rung; by
		statement 2 again you can get to the fourth; and so on. You can climb as high as you wish. Both assertions here are
		necessary. If only statement 1 is true, you have no guarantee of getting beyond the first rung, and if only
		statement 2 is true, you may never be able to get started. <Br>

		<h2>First Principle of Induction</h2>
		<pre>
1. P(1) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(1 has property P)
2. For any positive integer k, P(k) &rarr; P(k+1) (If any number has property P, so does the next number.)

If we can prove both assertions 1 and 2, then P(n) holds for any positive integer n.
The foundation for arguments of this type is the <b><font color="blue">first principle of mathematical induction:</font></b>
</pre>

		<b>
			<font color="blue">
				\[
				\left.
				\begin{cases}
				\text{1. P(1) is true} \\
				\text{2. P(k) &rarr; P(k+1) is true} \\
				\end{cases}
				\right\}
				\text{P(n) true for all positive integers n}
				\]
			</font>
		</b>
		The first principle of mathematical induction is an implication. The conclusion is a statement of the form, "P(n) is
		true for all positive integers n." <b><font color="red">Therefore, whenever we want to prove that
		something is true for every positive integer n, mathematical induction is an appropriate proof technique to use.</font></b>
		<Br>
		To know that the conclusion of this implication is true, we show that the two hypotheses, statements 1 and 2, are
		true. To prove statement 1, we need only show that property P holds for the number 1, usually a trivial task.
		Statement 2 is also an implication that must hold for all k. To prove this implication, we assume for an arbitrary
		positive integer k that P(k) is true and show,
		based on this assumption, that P(k+1) is true.
		<Br>

			<font color="blue">Reminder:</font>
		</b>
		To prove something true for all \(n &ge; \) some value, think induction.
		<br>
		<h2>Proofs by Mathematical Induction</h2>
		Suppose that the ancestral proggenitor Smith married and had two children.
		Let's call these two children generation 1. Now suppose each of those two
		children had two children; then in generation 2, there were four offspring.
		This trend continued from generation to generation. It appears that
		generation n contains \(2^n\) offspring. More formally, if we let \(P(n)\) denote the number of offspring at
		generation n, then we guess that:
		<br>
		<br>
		<center>
			\( P(n) = 2^n \)
		</center>

		We can use induction to prove that our guests for \(P(n)\) is correct.
		<Br>
		<Br>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">Basic step -- the proof that the statement is true for the first integer</font>
		</b>
		<br>
		<Br>
		<center>
			\(P(1) = 2^1 = 2\)
		</center>
		<br>
		This is true because we are told that Smith has two children. We now assume that our guess is correct for an
		arbitrary generation \(k\), \(k &ge; 1\); that is, we assume \(P(k) = 2^k\) and try to show that \(P(k+1) =
		2^{k+1}\).
		<Br>
		<Br>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">Induction step -- the proof that \(P(k) &rarr; P(k+1)\) is true</font>
		</b> (i.e., if it is true for some integer, then it is true for the next integer)
		<br>
		<br>
		In this family, each offspring has two children; thus the number of offspring at generation \(k+1\) will be twice
		the number at generation \(k\), or \(P(k+1) = 2P(k)\). By the inductive assumption, \(P(k) = 2^k\), so <br>
		<br>
		<center>
			\( P(k+1) = 2*P(k) = 2*(2^k) = 2^{k+1} \)
		</center>
		<br>
		and so indeed: <br><br>
		<center>
			\( P(k+1) = 2^{k+1} \)
		</center>
		This completes our proof.
		<br>

		<h2>Examples</h2>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">Example 1:</font>
		</b> <Br>
		<br>
		Prove that the following equation is true for any positive integer \(n\). <br>
		<br>
		<center>
			\( 1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2n - 1) = n^2\) (Eq. 1)
		</center>
		<br>
		<b>
			<font color="red">Basic Step:</font>
		</b> <br>
		The basic step is to establish \(P(1)\), which is equation (1) when \(n\) has the value 1. <br>
		<br>
		P(1): <br><br>
		left side: \(2\times1-1 = 1\)  <br>
		right side: \(1^2\) <br>

		<center>
			\(P(1): 1 = 1^2\)
		</center>
		<br>
		P(1) is true <br>

		<br>
		This is certainly true. For the inductive hypothesis, we assume \(P(k)\) for an arbitrary positive integer \(k\),
		which is equation (1) when \(n\) has the value \(k\), or <br>
		<Br>
		<center>
			\(P(k): 1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k-1) = k^2\)
		</center>
		<br>
		<b>
			<font color="red">Induction Step:</font>
		</b> <br>
		Using the inductive hypothesis, we want to show \(P(k+1)\), which is equation (1) when \(n\) has the value \(k+1\),
		or <br>
		<Br>
		<center>
			\(P(k+1): 1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + [2(k+1)-1] = (k+1)^2\)
		</center>
		<br>
		The left side of \(P(k+1)\) can be rewritten to show the next-to-last term: <br>
		<br>
		<center>
			\(1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + [2(k+1)-1]\) <br>
			\( = 1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2k-1) + [2(k+1)-1]\) <Br>
			\( = k^2 + [2(k+1)-1]\) <Br>
			\( = k^2 + [2k + 2 - 1]\) <Br>
			\( = k^2 + 2k + 1\) <br>
			\( = (k+1)^2 \)
		</center>
		<br>
		Therefore, <br>
		<center>
			\(1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + [2(k+1) - 1] = (k+1)^2\)
		</center>
		This completes our proof. <br>
		<br>
		<hr>

		<b>
			<font color="blue">Example 2:</font>
		</b> <Br>
		<br>
		Prove that for any positive integer \(n &ge; 1\), <br>
		<center>
			\(1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^n = 2^{n+1}-1 \) (Eq. 2)
		</center>
		<br>
		<b>
			<font color="red">Basic Step:</font>
		</b> <br>
		The basic step is to establish \(P(1)\), which is equation (2) when \(n\) has the value 1. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		P(1): <br><br>
		left side: \(1 + 2^1\) = 3<br><br>
		right side: \(2^{1+1}-1\) = 3 <br>

		<center>
			\(P(1): 1 + 2^1 = 2^{1+1} - 1 = 2^2 - 1\)
		</center>
		<br>
		which is true. We take \(P(k) = 1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} -1\) as the inductive hypothesis and try to
		establish:<br>
		<br>
		<center>
			\( P(k+1): 1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{k+1} = 2^{k+1+1} - 1\)
		</center>
		<br>
		<b>
			<font color="red">Induction Step:</font>
		</b> <br>
		Rewrite the sum on the left side of \(P(k+1)\) reveals how the inductive assumption can be used: <br>
		<br>
		<center>
			\( 1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{k+1} \)<br>
			\( = 1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^k + 2^{k+1}\) <br>
			\( = 2^{k+1} - 1 + 2^{k+1} \) <br>
			\( = 2\times2^{k+1} - 1\) <br>
			\( = 2^{k+1+1} - 1\)
		</center>
		Therefore: <br>
		<center>
			\( 1 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{k+1} = 2^{k+1+1} - 1\)
		</center>
		<br>
		which completes our proof.
		<br>
		<br>
		<hr>
		Not all proofs by induction involve formulas with sums. Other algebraic identities about
		the positive integers, as well as nonalgebraic assertions like the number
		of offspring in generation n of the Smith family, can be proved by induction.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">Example 3:</font>
		</b> <Br>
		<br>
		Prove that the following equation is true for any positive integer \(n\). <br>
		<br>
		<center>
			\( 2^n > n\) (Eq. 3)
		</center>
		<br>
		<b>
			<font color="red">Basic Step:</font>
		</b> <br>
		The basic step is to establish \(P(1)\), which is equation (3) when \(n\) has the value 1. <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		P(1): <br><br>
		left side: \(2^1\) <br>
		right side: \(1\) <br>
		<center>
			\(P(1): 2^1 > 1\)
		</center>
		<br>
		This is certainly true. For the inductive hypothesis, we assume \(P(k)\) for an arbitrary positive integer \(k\),
		which is equation (3) when \(n\) has the value \(k\), or <br>
		<center>
			\(P(k): 2^k > k\)
		</center>
		<br>
		<b>
			<font color="red">Induction Step:</font>
		</b> <br>
		Using the inductive hypothesis, we want to show \(P(k+1)\), which is equation (3) when \(n\) has the value \(k+1\),
		or <br>
		<Br>
		<center>
			\(P(k+1): 2^{k+1} > k + 1\)
		</center>
		<br>
		The left side of \(P(k+1)\) can be rewritten: <br>
		<br>
		<center>
			\( 2^{k+1} = 2^k \times 2^1 = 2^k\times2 = 2\times2^k\) (exponential rule: \(a^{m+n} = a^m + a^n \)) <br>
			\( 2^{k+1} = 2\times2^k > 2\timesk \) (Multiplication Property of Inequality) <br>
			\( 2\timesk= k + k &ge; k + 1\) (because k &ge; 1)<br>
			\(\)
		</center>
		<br>
		Since we established that: <br>
			<center>\( 2^{k+1}  > 2\timesk \) </center> <br>
		and that:  <br>
			<center>\( 2\timesk  &ge; k + 1 \) </center>
		<br>
		Therefore, we can conclude by the <b><font color="blue">Transitive Property</font></b> that: <br>
		<center>
			\( 2^{k+1} > k+1 \)
		</center>
		This completes our proof. <br>
