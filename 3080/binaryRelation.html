			<h2>Section 7.1 Directed Graphs and Binary Relations</h2>
		</center>

		<br>
		<br>

		In this section we confine our attention to (unweighted) directed graphs with no parallel arcs. Because there are no
		parallel arcs in the graph, the adjacency matrix will be a Boolean matrix, that is, a matrix whose only elements are
		0s and 1s. Conversely, given an \(n \times n\) Boolean matrix, we can reconstruct the directed graph that the matrix
		represents, and it will have no parallel arcs. Thus there is a one-to-one correspondence, which we can picture as

		<h2>Directed Graphs and Binary Relations</h2>
		Suppose G is a directed graph with n nodes and no parallel arcs. Let N be the set of nodes. If \( (n_i, n_j) \) is
		an ordered pair of nodes, then there either is or is not an arc in G from \(n_i\) to \(n_j\). We can use this
		property to define a binary relation on the set N: <Br>
		<center>
			\(n_i\) &#961; \(n_j\) &harr; there is an arc in G from \(n_i\) to \(n_j\)
		</center>
		<br>
		This relation is the <b>adjacency relation</b> of the graph.
		<br>
		<br>
		<center>

		</center>
		<br>
		Conversely, if &#961; is a binary relation on a set N, we can define a directed graph G with N as the set of nodes,
		and an arc from \(n_i\) to \(n_j\) if and only if \(n_i\) &#961; \(n_j\). G will have no parallel arcs.

		We now have another one-to-one correspondence:
		<br>
		<center>
			<img width="70%" src="images/one-to-one2.png">
		</center>
		<br>
		Thus We have three equivalent sets: <br>
		<center>

		<br>
		An item from any of the three sets has corresponding representations in the other two sets.

		<h2>Reachability</h2>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">
				Reachable Node: <br>
				In a directed graph, node \(n_j\) is <font color="red">reachable</font> from node \(n_i\) if there is a path
				from \(n_i\) to \(n_j\).
			</font>
		</b>
		<br><br>
		<center>
			<img width="90%" src="images/binaryRelation4.png">
		</center>
		<br>
		The adjacency matrix a of a directed graph G with n nodes and no parallel
		arcs will have a 1 in position i, j if there is an arc from \(n_i\) to \(n_j\). This would be a path of length 1
		from \(n_i\) to \(n_j\). The <b><font color="red">adjacency matrix</font></b> by itself therefore tells us about a limited form of reachability, via
		<b><font color="red">length-1 paths</font></b>. However, let us perform the <b>
			<font color="blue">Boolean matrix multiplication \(A \times A\)</font>
		</b>. We'll denote this product by <b>
			<font color="red">\(A^{(2)}\)</font>
		</b> to distinguish it from \(A^2\), the result of \(A&middot;A\) using
		ordinary matrix multiplication.

		A path of length 2 from \(n_i\) to \(n_j\) will exist if and only there is a path of length 2 passing through at
		least one of the nodes from 1 to n, that is, if and only if \(A^{(2)}[i,j] = 1\). Therefore the entries in
		<b><font color="red">\(A^{(2)}\)</font></b> tell us about reachability via <b><font color="red">length-2 paths</font></b>.
		This pattern continues, with <b><font color="red">\(A^{(n)}\)</font></b> indicating reachability via <b><font color="red">length-n paths</font></b>.
		The longest path you can check is limited to n, the total number of nodes.
		<br>
		<h3>Practice 2</h3>
		<center>
			<img width="90%" src="images/binaryRelation_p2.png">
		</center>

		<br>
		The matrix \(A^{(2)}\) indicates the presence or absence of length-2 paths. We might surmise that this result
		holds
		for arbitrary powers and path lengths.
		<br><br>
		<center>
			<img width="90%" src="images/binaryRelation5.png">
		</center>
		<br>
		We can define a <b>
			<font color="blue">reachability matrix R</font>
		</b> by:
		<br>
		<center>
			<b>
				\( R = A &or; A^{(2)} &or; &hellip; &or; A^{(n)} \)
			</b>
		</center>
		<br>
		Then \(n_j\) is reachable from \(n_i\) is and only if entry \(i,j\) in <b>R</b> is positive. <br>
		To summarize, corresponding to the three equivalent representations of adjacency relation &#961;, directed graph
		G,
		and adjacency matrix A, we have
