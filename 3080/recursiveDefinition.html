		<h1>Recursive Definitions</h1>

		A definition in which the item being defined appears as part of the definition is called a <b>
			<font color="blue">recursive definition</font>
		</b>. At first this seems like nonsense -- how can we define something in terms of itself? This works because there
		are two parts to a recursive definition: <br>
		<br>
		1. A basis, where some simple cases of the item being defined are explicitly given <br>
		2. An inductive or recursive step, where new cases of the item beding defined are given in terms of previous cases.
		<br>
		<br>
		Part 1 gives us a place to start by providing some simple, concrete cases; part 2 allows us to construct new cases
		from these simple ones and then to construct still other cases from these new ones, and so forth. <Br>
		<br>
		Recursion is an important idea that can be used to define sequences of objects, more general collections of objects,
		and operations on objects. Even algorithms can be recursive.
		<br>
		<br>
		From a practitioner's perspective, recursive procedures are simple to write, but they are extremely
		memory-intensive, and it can be difficult to predict how much memory will be required.
		<br>
		<h2>Recursively Defined Sequences</h2>
		A <b>sequence</b> S (an <b>infinite sequence</b>) is a list of objects that are enumerated in some order; there is a
		first such object, then a second, and so on. S(k) denotes the \(k_{th}\) object in the sequence. The list goes on
		forever, so a sequence therefore consists of <br>
		<br>
		<center>
			S(1), S(2), ..., S(k), ...
		</center>
		<br>
		Subscript notation is often used to denote the elements in a sequence, as in <br>
		<center>
			\( S_1, S_2, ..., S_k, ... \)
		</center>
		<br>
		The letter S is just a "dummy variable", so a sequence could also be denoted by
		<br>
		<center>
			\( a_1, a_2, ..., a_k, ...\) &nbsp; &nbsp; or &nbsp; &nbsp; \(w_1, w_2,...,w_k,...\)
		</center>
		and so forth.
		<br>
		<h2>Example</h2>

		<pre>
<b><font color="blue">&bull; Example 1: </font></b>

The sequence S is defined recursively by

     1. S(1) = 2
     2. S(n) = 2S(n-1)  for n &ge; 2
</pre>
		By statement 1, S(1), the first object in S, is 2.<Br>
		By statement 2, S(2), the second object in S is S(2) = 2S(1) = 2*2 = 4. <br>
		By statement 2 again, S(3) = 2S(2) = 2*4 = 8. <Br>
		Continuing in this fashion, we can see that S is the sequence <Br>
		<center>
			2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...
		</center>
		<Br>
		A rule like that of statement 2 in Example 1, which defines a sequence value in terms of one or more earlier values,
		is called a <b>
			<font color="blue">recurrence relation.</font>
		</b>

		Suppose we want to write a computer program to evaluate S(n) for some positive integer n. We
		can use two approaches: <b>

		</b> or <b>

		</b>.

		<h2>Example</h2>
		<pre>
<b><font color="blue">&bull; Example 2: </font></b>

The <b>Fibonacci sequence</b> of numbers, introduced in the thirteenth century by
an Italian merchant and mathematician, is defined recursively by:

     1. F(0) = 0
     2. F(1) = 1
     3. F(n) = F(n-2) + F(n-1) for n > 1
</pre>
		By statement 1, F(0), the first object in F, is 0.<Br>
		By statement 2, F(1), the second object in F, is 1. <br>
		By statement 3, F(2) = F(0) + F(1) = 0 + 1 = 1. <Br>
		By statement 3 again, F(3) = F(1) + F(2) = 1 + 1 = 2. <Br>
		Continuing in this fashion, we can see that F is the sequence <Br>
		<center>
			0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
