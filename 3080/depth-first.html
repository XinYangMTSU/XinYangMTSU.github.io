			<h2>Section 7.4 Traversal Algorithms</h2>
		</center>

		<br>
		<br>

		In this section we deal with a simpler problem--we only want to write down all the nodes of a simple, connected
		graph G in some orderly way. This means we must find a path that visits each node at least once, but we can visit it
		more than once if we don't write it down again. We can also retrace arcs on the graph if necessary, and clearly this
		would in general be necessary if we were to visit each node in a tree. This process is called <b>
			<font color="blue">graph traversal</font>
		</b>. We already have several mechanisms for tree traversal (Section 6.2). The two algorithms in this section
		generalize traversal to apply to any simple, connected graph.


		<h2>Depth-First Search</h2>

		In the depth-first search algorithm for graph traversal, we begin at an arbitrary node a of the graph, mark it
		visited, and write it down. We then strike out on a path away from a, visiting and writing down nodes, proceeding as
		far as pos- sible until there are no more unvisited nodes on that path. We then back up the path, at each node
		exploring any new side paths, until finally we retreat back to a. We then explore any new paths remaining from a.
		Figure 7.13 shows a graph after the first few nodes (marked by circles) have been visited using depth-first search.

		For a more formal description of the depth-first search algorithm we will use recursion, where the algorithm invokes
		itself in the course of its execution. In the following algorithm, the input is a simple, connected graph G and a
		specified node a; the output is a list of all nodes in G in depth-first order from a.

		In the recursive step, the algorithm is invoked with a new node specified as the starting point.
