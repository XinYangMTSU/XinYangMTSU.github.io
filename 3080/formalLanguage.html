		<br>
		Languages derived from grammars such as we have defined are called <font color="blue"><b>formal languages</b></font>
		. If the grammar is defined
		first, the language will follow as an outcome of the definition.<br>

		Because of the relationships among the four grammar types, we can classify languages as shown in Figure 9.26. Thus,
		any regular language is also context-free because any regular grammar is also a context-free grammar, and so on.
		Any language at a lower (simpler) level automatically belongs to every higher (more powerful) level.

		The <b><font color="blue">Chomsky hierarchy</font></b> is a classification of formal grammars, 
		which are systems for generating strings of symbols according to certain rules. 
		<br>
		The hierarchy consists of four levels of grammars, each capable of generating increasingly complex sets of languages:
		<ul>
			<li>Type 0 – Recursively Enumerable Languages (Unrestricted Grammar)</li>
			<li>Type 1 – Context-Sensitive Languages (Context-Sensitive Grammar)</li>
			<li>Type 2 – Context-Free Languages (Context-Free Grammar)</li>
			<li>Type 3 – Regular Languages (Regular Grammar)</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Formal Languages and Computational Devices</h1>
		The class of sets recognized by a computational device of limited capacity coincides with the most restricted class
		of languages.
		The most general computational device is the <font color="blue"><b>Turing machine</b></font> and the most general
		language is a <font color="red"><b>type 0 language</b></font>. As
		it happens, the sets recognized by Turing machines correspond to type 0 languages.
		<br><br>
		There are computational devices with capabilities midway between those of finite-state machines and those of Turing
		machines. These devices recognize exactly the context-free languages and the context-sensitive languages,
		respectively.
		<br><br>

		The type of device that recognizes context-free languages is called a <b>
			<font color="blue">pushdown automaton</font>
		</b>, or <b>
			<font color="blue">pda</font>
		</b>.
		A pda consists of a finite-state unit that reads input from a tape and controls activity in a stack. Symbols from
		some alphabet can be pushed onto or popped off of the top of the stack. The finite-state unit in a pda, as a
		function of the input symbol read, the present state, and the top symbol on the stack, has a finite number of
		possible next moves. <b>
			<font color="blue">It can be shown that any set recognized by a pda is a <font color="red">context-free</font>
				language, and
				conversely.</font>
		</b>

		<br><br>

		The type of device that recognizes the context-sensitive languages is called a <b>
			<font color="blue">lba
		</b></font>. <font color="blue">lba</font> stands for <font color="blue">"Linear Bounded Automaton"</font>. An lba is a Turing machine whose read-write head is restricted to a portion
		of
		the tape that is no
		longer than a constant multiple of the length of the original input; in addition, at each step it has a choice
		of
		possible next moves. An lba recognizes the set of all inputs for which some sequence of moves exists that causes
		it to halt in a final state. <b>
			<font color="blue">Any set recognized by an lba can be shown to be a
				<font color="red">context-sensitive</font> language, and conversely.
			</font>
		</b>

		<br>
		<br>
		Figure 9.27 shows the relationship between the hierarchy of languages and the hierarchy of computational devices.

		The Chomsky hierarchy provides a framework for understanding the relationships between these models and the classes of languages they can recognize.

		<h2>Formal Languages</h2>

		<h3>Regular Language:</h3>
		A regular language is like a simple language that follows a set of easy-to-understand rules. Imagine you have
		a
		magic toy that only allows you to press certain buttons in a specific order to make it work. The toy will do
		different things depending on the buttons you press. A regular language is like a set of rules that tells you
		which
		buttons you can press and in what order to make the toy work. It's simple and easy to understand because the
		rules
		are straightforward and don't have any complicated conditions.

		<h3>Context-Free Language:</h3>
		A context-free language is like a language that has a few more rules than a regular language. Imagine you're
		playing
		with a set of building blocks, and you have a set of instructions that tell you how to stack the blocks. The
		instructions might say things like "put a green block on top of a red block" or "put a blue block next to a
		yellow
		block." These instructions give you more flexibility in how you can stack the blocks, but they still have some
		limitations. A context-free language is like a set of rules that tell you how to arrange words or symbols in a
		sentence. The rules allow you to combine words in different ways, but they still have some restrictions.

		<h3>
			Context-Sensitive Language:</h3>
		A context-sensitive language is like a language with even more rules and flexibility. Imagine you have a
		storytelling game where you can create your own adventure. In this game, you can add characters, locations,
		and
		events to the story, and you can even change the rules of the game as you go. A context-sensitive language is
		like a
		set of rules that give you a lot of freedom to create your own story. You can add new characters, change the
		order
		of events, and modify the rules of the game, as long as everything still makes sense within the context of the
		story.

		<h3>Type 0 Language:</h3>
		Type 0 languages are the most powerful and flexible type of language. They can describe any kind of language,
		no
		matter how complex. Imagine you have a magic pen that can write any word or sentence you imagine. With this
		pen, you
		can write stories, poems, or even create your own language. Type 0 languages allow you to define your own
		rules and
		create new words and sentences that have never been seen before.
		<br><br>
		To summarize, regular languages have simple and straightforward rules, context-free languages have more
		flexibility
		but still have some restrictions, context-sensitive languages give you even more freedom to create your own
		rules,
		and type 0 languages allow you to define your own rules and create new words and sentences.
