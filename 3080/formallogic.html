		<h1> Formal Symbols of Propositional Logic</h1>

		Logic is a fundamental concept in computing, serving as the essential framework that governs 
		how computers process and manipulate data, make informed decisions, and execute a wide range of 
		instructions. By utilizing logical principles and operations, computers are able to perform 
		everything from simple arithmetic calculations to complex problem-solving tasks. 
		The underlying binary logic, which is based on true and false values (represented as 1s and 0s), 
		enables computers to process vast amounts of information accurately and efficiently. 
		This logical foundation allows computers to determine the appropriate actions to take, 
		control the flow of programs, and carry out sequences of operations that drive the 
		functionality of both hardware and software.
		
		<h2>Formal Logic History</h2>
		Logic has been studied since the classical Greek period ( 600-300BC). The Greeks,
		most notably Thales was the first to formally analyze the reasoning process. 
		<br><br>
		Aristotle (384-322BC), the "father of
		logic", and many other Greeks searched for universal
		truths that were irrefutable. Aristotle developed the first system of formal logic, 
		known as syllogistic logic, which focuses on the logical relationships between statements, 
		or propositions. A syllogism is a form of reasoning where a conclusion is drawn 
		from two given or assumed propositions (premises). This form of logic is foundational and was the 
		dominant system of logic until the development of modern symbolic logic in the 19th century.
		<br><br>
		A second great period for logic came with the use of symbols to simplify complicated
		logical arguments. Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716) began
		this work at age 14, but failed to provide a workable foundation for symbolic logic.
		<br><br>
		George Boole (1815-1864) is considered the "father of symbolic logic" due to his groundbreaking work 
		in the development of a system of logic that uses symbols and algebraic methods to 
		represent and analyze logical statements. Boole's work laid the foundation for modern mathematical 
		logic and had a profound impact on the fields of mathematics, computer science, and philosophy.
		He developed logic as an abstract mathematical system consisting of defined terms (propositions),
		operations (conjunction, disjunction, and negation), and rules for using the operations. It is this system that we
		will study in the first section.
		<br>
		<br>

		Logic provides a powerful tool for reasoning correctly about mathematics, algorithms and computers. It is used
		extensively throughout computer science, and you need to understand its basic concepts in order to study many of the
		more advanced subjects in computing.

		<b><font color="blue">Propositional Logic</font></b>, also known as sentential logic or statement logic, is a branch of logic that deals with 
		<b><font color="blue">propositions (statements)</font></b> that can be either true or false, but not both. 
		It focuses on the <b><font color="blue">logical relationships and operations</font></b> between propositions using <b><font color="blue">logical connectives</font></b>.
		
		<h2>Proposition</h2>
		Formal logic can represent the statements we use in English to communicate facts or information. 
		A <b><font color="blue">statement</font></b> (or <b><font color="blue">proposition</font></b>) is a sentence that is either true or false.
		<br><br>
		A <b>
			<font color="blue">proposition</font>
		</b> is a statement that is, either <font color="blue"><b>true or false</b></font> -- <font color="blue"><b>not both</b></font>.

		<h4>Some Sample Propositions</h4>
		&bull; MTSU is in Murfreesboro. <font color="red"><b>&check;</b></font> <br>
		&bull; The Earth orbits the Sun. <font color="red"><b>&check;</b></font> <br>
		&bull; 4 > 9 <font color="red"><b>&check;</b></font><br>
		&bull; Is this CSCI 3080? <font color="red"><b>No (Question)</b></font><br>
		&bull; Close the door. <font color="red"><b>No (Command)</b></font><br>
		&bull; Oatmeal is slimy <font color="red"><b>No (Opinion)</b></font><br>
		&bull; x > y <font color="red"><b>No (depends on x and y; sometime are true, sometimes are wrong)</b></font><Br>

		<h4>Things that aren't propositions</h4>

		&bull; <b>
			<font color="blue">Commands</font>
		</b> cannot be true or false.
		<br>
		&bull; <b>
			<font color="blue">Questions</font>
		</b> cannot be true or false.
		<br>
		&bull; <b>
			<font color="blue">Jibberish</font>
		</b> cannot be true or false.
		<br>
		&bull; <b>
			<font color="blue">Suggestions or Recommendations</font>
		</b> cannot be true or false.
		


		<h2>Propositional Logic</h2>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">Propositional logic</font>
		</b> is a mathematical system for
		reasoning about propositions and how they relate to
		one another.
		<br>
		<br>
		&#11088; Propositional logic is a formal mathematical
		system whose syntax is rigidly specified.
		<br>
		&#11088; Every statement in propositional logic consists of
		<b>
			<font color="blue">propositional variables</font>
		</b> combined via <b>
			<font color="blue">logical
				connectives</font>
		</b>.
		<br><br>
		<b>Propositional logic</b> is a branch of logic that deals with <b>propositions</b>, 
		which are statements that can be either true or false. 
		It is the <b>foundation of formal logic</b> and is often used in mathematical reasoning, 
		computer science, and philosophy. Propositional logic focuses on the relationships 
		between <b>propositions</b> and how they can be combined and manipulated using 
		<b>logical connectives</b> to form more complex statements.
		
		<br>

		<h2>Propositional Variables</h2>
		&#10058; Each proposition will be represented by a
		<b>
			<font color="blue">propositional variable</font>
		</b>

		
		<br>
		&#10058; Propositional variables are usually
		represented as <b>
			<font color="blue">capital-case</font>
		</b> letters, such
		as \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), etc. If we need more, we can use subscripts: \(A_1\), \(A_2\), etc.
		<br>
		&#10058; Each variable can take one one of two
		values: true or false.
		<h2>Logical Connectives</h2>

		The truth table for implication is less obvious than that for conjunction or disjunction. To understand its
		definition, let's suppose your friend remarks, "if I pass my economics test, then I'll go to the movie Friday." If
		your friend passes the test and goes to the movie, the remark was true. If your friend passes the test but doesn't
		go to the movie, the remark was false. If your friend doesn't pass the test, then-whether he or she goes to the
		movie or not-- you could not claim that the remark was false. By convention, \(A &rarr; B\) is considered true if A
		is false, regardless of the truth value of B.

		Unlike conjunction, disjunction, and implication, the equivalence connective is not really a fundamental
		connective but a convenient shortcut. The expression \(A &harr; B\) stands for \((A &rarr; B) &and; (B &rarr; A)\).
		We can write the truth table for equivalence by constructing, one piece at a time, a truth table for \( (A &rarr; B)
		&and; (B &rarr; A) \). From the following truth table, \(A &harr; B\) is true exactly when A and B have the same
		truth value.
