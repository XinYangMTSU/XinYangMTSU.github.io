		<center>
			<h2>Section 6.3 Decision Trees</h2>
		</center>

		<br>
		<br>
		We learn decision trees when studying the lower bound of searching and sorting because they provide a visual and theoretical framework to understand the minimum number of comparisons 
		required to solve these problems.

		<h2>Decision Tree</h2>
		A <b>
			<font color="blue">decision tree</font>
		</b> is a <font color="blue"><b>tree-like structure</b></font> used to model decision-making processes, where the internal nodes represent actions, the arcs represent outcomes of an action and the
		leaves represent final outcomes.  It's particularly useful for visualizing and understanding the steps an algorithm follows to reach a conclusion.
		<br>
		<br>
		Sometimes useful information can be obtained by using a decision tree to represent the activities of a real
		algorithm; actions that the algorithm performs take place at internal nodes, the children of an internal node
		represent the next action taken, based on the outcome of the previous action, and the leaves represent some sort of
		circumstance that can be inferred upon algorithm termination.
		<br>
		<h1>Decision Tree in Search Algorithms</h1>
		In the context of search algorithms, a decision tree helps us understand the number of steps 
		(comparisons) required to find an element or determine that itâ€™s not present in a list.
		<br><br>
		We learn decision trees in search algorithms to:
		<ul>
			<li>&clubs; <b><font color="blue">Visualize</font></b> how decisions branch out.</li>
			<li>&clubs; <b><font color="blue">Model</font></b> the search space (e.g., every possible action and state).</li>
			<li>&clubs; <b><font color="blue">Understand efficiency</font></b> (e.g., why binary search takes \(log_2(n)\) decisions).</li>
		</ul>
			<br>
		<h2>Searching</h2>
		A search algorithm either finds a target element x within a list of elements or determines that x is not in the
		list. Such an algorithm generally works by making successive comparisons of x to the list items. We have already
		seen two such algorithms, <b>
			<font color="blue">sequential search</font>
		</b> and <b>
			<font color="blue">binary search</font>
		</b>.We can model the activities of these algorithms by using decision trees.The nodes represent the actions of
		comparing x to the list items, where the comparison of x to the ith element in the list is denoted by x:L[i]. <br>
		<br>
		<h3>1. Sequential Search (also called Linear Search)</h3>
		<hr>
		<ul>
			<li>In sequential search, the algorithm compares the target element \(x\) with each element in the list one by one, 
		starting from the first element.</li>
			<li>If  \(x=L[i]\), the target is found, the search ends.</li>
			<li>If \(x!=L[i]\), the search moves to the next element \(L[i+1]\).</li>
			<li>The <b>decision tree</b> for sequential search is linear, with each comparison leading directly to the next. 
		The worst-case scenario, where the target element is not in the list, requires \(n\) comparisons for a list of 
		\(n\)elements. The depth of the tree is therefore \(n\), as every node represents one comparison.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<br>
		
		Sequential search only distinguishes between two possible outcomes of a comparison of x to L[i]. If x = L[i], the
		algorithm terminates because x has been found in the list. If x != L[i], the next comparison performed is x:L[i+1],
		regardless of whether x was less than or greater than L[i]. The leaves of this decision tree correspond to the final
		outcomes, where either x is one of the list items or x is not in the list.
		<br>
		<br>
		<center>
			<img width="600px" height="500px" src="images/decisionTree1.png">
		</center>
		<br>
		From the decision tree for a given search algorithm, we can see that the number of comparisons required to reach any
		particular outcome (leaf of the tree) is the number of internal nodes from the root to that leaf. This number equals
		the length of the path from the root to that leaf. The worst case, that is, the maximum number of comparisons, is
		the maximum length of any such path, which is the depth of the tree. <Br>
		<Br>
		Because every decision tree for sequential search looks like Figure 6.52, it is clear that the depth of such a tree,
		for an n-element list, is n. This agrees with what we already know, namely, that the worst case for sequential
		search on a list of n elements is n.

		</b></font>
		<br>
		
		<h3>2. Binary Search</h3>
		<hr>
		The decision tree for the binary search algorithm is more interesting. Binary search acts on a <b>
			<font color="red">sorted list</font>
		</b> and
		distinguishes between three possible outcomes of the comparison: <br>
		<pre>
x = L[i]: algorithm terminates, x has been found
x < L[i]: algorithm proceeds to the left half of the list 
x > L[i]: algorithm proceeds to the right half of the list
</pre>
		<br>
		If x < L[i], the next comparison the algorithm performs is found at the left child of this node; if x> L[i], the
			algorithm's next comparison is found at the right child. If no child exists, the algorithm terminates because x is
			not in the list. The tree we've described is a binary tree whose leaves represent all the possible outcomes where
			x is not in the list. There are many more failure leaves in binary search than in sequential search, because
			binary search indicates how x fails to be in the list (e.g., x < L[1] or L[1] < x < L[2]). <br>
				<br>
				<center>
					<img width="600px" height="600px" src="images/binaryTree.png">
				</center>

				The <b>decision tree</b> for <b>binary search</b> is a binary tree, where each comparison divides the list into two parts. 
				The depth of the tree is \(log_2(n)\), making it much shallower than that of the sequential search. 
				The worst-case scenario requires only \(log_2(n)\) comparisons.

	<li>&clubs; The number of times you can divide <font color="blue"><b>n</b></font> by <font color="blue"><b>2</b></font> before you reach 1 element is <font color="blue"><b>\( log_2(n) = k \)</b></font>.</li>

				<h1>Lower Bound for Searching</h1>
				<b>
					<font color="blue" size="5">Theorem: On the Lower Bound for Searching</font>
				</b>				
				<br>
				<font color="blue">
					Any algorithm that solves the search problem for an n-element list by comparing the target element x to the
					list items must do at least <b>
						<font color="red" size="4">&llcorner;\(log_2n\)&lrcorner;+1</font>
					</b> comparisons in the worst case.
				</font>
				<br>
				<Br>
				This theorem gives us a lower bound on the number of comparisons required in the worst case for any algorithm
				that uses comparisons to solve the search problem. Since binary search does no more work than this required
				minimum amount, binary search is an optimal algorithm in its worst-case behavior.
				<br>
				<br>
				(Lower bound means no algorithm can get faster than this no matter what, so if an algorithm actually does this,
				then it is optimal for worst case scenario)
				<br>
				<b>
					<font color="red" size="5">Note:</font>
				</b>
				<br>
				(1) <b>
					<font size="5">&llcorner;&lrcorner;</font>
				</b> means floor. The floor is the largest integer that is smaller than or equal to the number inside the floor
				signs.<br>
				For example: <Br>
				<b>
					<font size="4">&llcorner;2.9&lrcorner;=2</font>
				</b> <Br>
				<b>
					<font size="4">&llcorner;2.2&lrcorner;=2</font>
				</b> <br>
				<b>
					<font size="4">&llcorner;2&lrcorner;=2</font>
				</b> <Br>
				<br>
				(2) <b>log</b> is actually base 2 even though they didn't put the base in the statement of the theorem.It is
				stated elsewhere. <Br>
				<Br>
				(3) <b>\(log_2x = y\)</b> means \(2^y=x\) so <b>logn</b> means that we want the exponent we would need to put on
				2 in order to get n. <Br>
				<Br>
				(4) Example 1:<br>
				Any algorithm that solves the search problem for a <b><font color="blue">5687-element</font></b> list by comparing the target
				element x to the list items must do at least __________ comparisons in the worst case. <br>
				Solution: <b>
					<font size="4">&llcorner;\(log_2 5687\) &lrcorner;+1 = &llcorner;12.????&lrcorner; + 1
						= 12 + 1 = 13</font>
				</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				How did we get this? The table below has powers of 2 up to \(2^{13}\), and if we want to know the value of x
				when \(2^x=5687\) (because log 5687 = x means \(2^x=5687\)), then looking in the table (4096 < 5687 < 8192), so
					x must be between 12 and 13. Because of the floor, <b>
					<font size="4">&llcorner;12.???&lrcorner; = 12</font></b>, we don't have to know the value of the ????.

					<h1>Binary Tree Search</h1>
					The binary search algorithm requires that data already be sorted. 
					If the data is <b><font color="red">unsorted</font></b>, you can't apply binary search directly.
					Arbitrary data can be organized into a
					a structure called a <b>
						<font color="blue">binary search tree (BST)</font>
					</b>, which can then be searched using a different algorithm called <b>
						<font color="blue">binary tree search</font>
					</b>. 

					<br><br>
					A binary search tree (BST) is a special kind of binary tree where:
					<ul>
						<li>&clubs; The <b><font color="blue">left child</font></b> of a node has values <b><font color="blue">less than the node</font></b>.</li>
						<li>&clubs; The <b><font color="blue">right child</font></b> has values <b><font color="blue">greater than the node</font></b>.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<br>
					To build a binary search tree, the first item of data is made the root of the tree. Successive items are
					inserted by comparing them to existing nodes, beginning with the root. If the item is less than a node, the
					next node tested is the left child; otherwise, it is the right child. When no child node exists, the new item
					becomes the child.
					<br>
					<br>

					Steps to build a BST:
					<ul>
						<li>1. Start with the <b><font color="blue">first item</font></b> as the <b><font color="blue">root</font></b>.</li>
						<li>2. For each <b><font color="blue">next item</font></b>: </li>
						<ul>
							<li>Compare it to the <b><font color="blue">current node</font></b> (starting at the root).</li>
							<li>If the item is <b><font color="blue">less</font></b>, move to the <b><font color="blue">left child</font></b>.</li>
							<li>If the item is <b><font color="blue">greater</font></b>, move to the <b><font color="blue">right child</font></b>.</li>
							<li>If there is <b><font color="blue">no left or right child</font></b>, insert the new item there.</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					
					<center>
						<img width="50%" src="images/binaryTree2.png">
					</center>
					<br>
					A <b>
						<font color="blue">binary search tree</font>
					</b>, by the way it is constructed, has the property that the value at each node is greater than all values in
					its left subtree (the subtree rooted at its left child) and less than all values in its right subtree.
					<br> <br>
					A <b>
						<font color="blue">binary tree search</font>
					</b> compares item x with a succession of nodes beginning with the root. If x equals the node item, the
					algorithm terminates; if x is less than the item, the left child is checked next; if x is greater than the
					item, the right child is checked next. If no child exists, the algorithm terminates because x is not in the
					list.
					<br><br>
					However, a binary search tree for a given set of data is not unique; the tree (and hence the depth of the
					tree) depends on the order in which the data items are inserted into the tree.
					<Br><br>
					The depth of a binary search tree for a given set of data items can vary. The depth of the tree in Figure 6.54
					is 4, while that of Figure 6.55 is 2. Thus the worst-case number of comparisons to search for an item can
					also vary. The tree-building process can be modified to keep the tree more "balanced" that is, short and wide
					rather than tall and skinny; such a modification reduces the depth of the tree and therefore the search time.
					Of course, we know from the theorem on the lower bound for searching that a certain minimum amount of work is
					required no matter how clever we are in building the tree.
