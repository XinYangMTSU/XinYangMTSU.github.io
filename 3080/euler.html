			1. The number of <b>odd nodes</b> in any graph is <b>even</b>.
			<Br>
			<br>
			2. An Euler path exists in a graph if there are zero or two odd nodes. <Br>
			If there are zero odd node, then the euler path can begin at any node and will end at the same node. <br> If there
			are two odd nodes, the euler path will begin at one odd node and end at the other odd node.
			<br>
			<br>
			3. If a graph has more than 2 odd nodes, then it has no Euler paths.

		<h2>Euler Path for Directed Graph</h2>
		At most one vertex has (outdegree) - (indegree) = 1 and at most one vertex has (indegree) - (outdegree) = 1 and all
		other vertices have equal in and out degrees.

		<h2>Example</h2>

		<Br>
		3. There are zero odd nodes. Yes, it has euler path. (eg: 1,2,6,3,1,4,6,5,1)
		<Br>
		<br>
		4. There are zero odd nodes. Yes, it has euler path. (eg: 1,2,4,1,5,4,6,2,3,6,5,3,1)

		<h3>
			<font color="red">Note:</font>
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; For an undirected graph, the degree of a vertex is equal to the number of adjacent vertices. A special
				case is a <b>
					<font color="blue">loop</font>
				</b>, which adds two to the degree. </li>
			<li>&#9733; For a directed graph, a <b>
					<font color="blue">loop</font>
				</b> adds one to the in degree and one to the out-degree.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>Hamiltonian Circuit</h2>
		<font color="blue">A <b>Hamiltonian circuit</b> in a graph is a cycle using every node of the graph.
		A Hamiltonian circuit is a circuit that visits every vertex once with no repeats.</font> <br>
		No efficient algorithm has ever been found to determine if a Hamiltonian circuit exists. <br>
		<br>
		Hamiltonian circuit problem can be solved for a given graph by trial and error. The algorithm is as follows: Start
		from one node of the graph and try some paths by choosing various arcs. If the path results in a repeated node, it is
		not a cycle, so throw it away and try a different path. If the path can be completed as a cycle, then see whether it
		visited every node; if not, throw it away and try a different path. Continue in this fashion until all possible
		paths have been tried or a Hamiltonian circuit has been found. The trial-and-error approach is theoretically
		possible, but it is practically impossible! In all but the smallest of graphs, there will simply be too many paths to
		try.

		<Br>
		3. No, it has no Hamiltonian circuit.
		<Br>
		<br>
		4. Yes, it has Hamiltonian circuit. (eg: 1,4,2,6,3,5,1)
		<br>
		<br>


		<h2>Practice</h2>
		1. Do the following graph have Euler path? <br>
		2. Do the following graph have Hamiltonian circuit? <br>
