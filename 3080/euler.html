			<h2>Section 7.2 Euler Path and Hamiltonian Circuit</h2>
		</center>

		<br>
		<br>
		An <b><font color="blue">Euler Path</font></b> (or Eulerian Path) is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. 
		It is named after the mathematician Leonhard Euler, 
		who first solved the famous <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/activity/seven-bridges-konigsberg.html" target="_blank">Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg</a> problem, which led to the foundation of graph theory.
		<br><br>
		üìò Famous Origin: The Seven Bridges of K√∂nigsberg <br><br>
		Leonhard Euler was trying to solve: <br><br>
		Is it possible to walk through the city and cross each of the seven bridges once without repeating any?
		<br><br>
		üß† Euler proved that it wasn‚Äôt possible, and this led to the birth of <b><font color="blue">graph theory</font></b>!

		
		<h2>Euler Path</h2>
		<font color="blue">An <b>Euler path</b> in a graph G is a path that uses each arc of G exactly once.</font>

		<Br>
		<b>Key Characteristics</b> of Euler Path:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Directed and Undirected Graphs:</b> Euler paths can be found in both directed and undirected graphs.</li>
			<li><b>Every Edge Once: </b> The key feature of an Euler path is that every edge must be visited exactly once, 
				but vertices can be visited more than once.</li>
			<li>An Euler path exists in a graph if there are <b>zero or two odd nodes</b>.</li>
		</ul>

			1. The number of <b>odd nodes</b> in any graph is <b>even</b>.
			<Br>
			<br>
			2. An Euler path exists in a graph if there are zero or two odd nodes. <Br>
			If there are zero odd node, then the euler path can begin at any node and will end at the same node. (Euler Circuit: closed path) <br> 
			If there
			are two odd nodes, the euler path will begin at one odd node and end at the other odd node.
			<br>
			<br>
			3. If a graph has more than 2 odd nodes, then it has no Euler paths.

		<h2>Euler Path for Directed Graph</h2>
		At most one vertex has (outdegree) - (indegree) = 1 and at most one vertex has (indegree) - (outdegree) = 1 and all
		other vertices have equal in and out degrees.

		3. There are zero odd nodes. Yes, it has euler path. (eg: 1,2,6,3,1,4,6,5,1)

		<h3>
			<font color="red">Note:</font>
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>&#9733; For an undirected graph, the degree of a vertex is equal to the number of adjacent vertices. A special
				case is a <b>
					<font color="blue">loop</font>
				</b>, which adds two to the degree. </li>
			<li>&#9733; For a directed graph, a <b>
					<font color="blue">loop</font>
				</b> adds one to the in degree and one to the out-degree.</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>Hamiltonian Circuit</h2>
		
		A Hamiltonian Circuit (or Hamiltonian Cycle) is a closed loop in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. 
		In contrast to an Euler Path, which visits every edge once, a Hamiltonian Circuit focuses on visiting every vertex once without revisiting any of them, 
		except for the return to the starting point.
		<br><br>
		<b>Key Characteristics</b> of a Hamiltonian Circuit:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Visits Every Vertex:</b> The circuit includes every vertex in the graph.</li>
			<li><b>No Repeated Vertices:</b> Each vertex is visited exactly once, except for the starting vertex, which is visited again at the end to complete the circuit.</li>
			<li><b>Closed Path:</b> The path ends where it started.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<font color="blue">A <b>Hamiltonian circuit</b> in a graph is a cycle using every node of the graph.
		A Hamiltonian circuit is a circuit that visits every vertex once with no repeats.</font> <br>
		No efficient algorithm has ever been found to determine if a Hamiltonian circuit exists. <br>
		<br>
		Hamiltonian circuit problem can be solved for a given graph by trial and error. The algorithm is as follows: Start
		from one node of the graph and try some paths by choosing various arcs. If the path results in a repeated node, it is
		not a cycle, so throw it away and try a different path. If the path can be completed as a cycle, then see whether it
		visited every node; if not, throw it away and try a different path. Continue in this fashion until all possible
		paths have been tried or a Hamiltonian circuit has been found. The trial-and-error approach is theoretically
		possible, but it is practically impossible! In all but the smallest of graphs, there will simply be too many paths to
		try.
		<br><br>
		Finding a Hamiltonian Circuit can be more complex than finding an Eulerian path, as there is no simple criterion (like degree conditions for Eulerian paths) 
		that guarantees the existence of a Hamiltonian Circuit. The Hamiltonian Circuit Problem is an NP-complete problem, 
		meaning it is computationally challenging to solve, especially for large graphs.

		<h2>Euler Paths give us the theoretical foundation for solving routing problems like:</h2>
		<ul>
		  <li>&star; Street sweeping</li>
		  <li>&star; Garbage pickup</li>
		  <li>&star; Mail/postal delivery</li>
		  <li>&star; Utility inspections</li>
		  <li>&star; Snow plowing</li>
		</ul>
		These are all cases where we want to <b><font color="blue">cover every edge (road) once</font></b>, 
		or as few times as possible.
		
		<h2>Hamiltonian Circuits give us the theoretical foundation for solving visit-every-location-once problems like:</h2>

		<ul>
		  <li>&star; Traveling sales routes</li>
		  <li>&star; Delivery driver planning</li>
		  <li>&star; School bus routing</li>
		  <li>&star; </li>
		  <li>&star; </li>
		</ul>
		These are all cases where we want to <b><font color="blue">visit every location (vertex) exactly once</font></b> and ideally return to the 
		starting point ‚Äî optimizing time, cost, or distance while <b><font color="blue">minimizing repeats</font></b>.
