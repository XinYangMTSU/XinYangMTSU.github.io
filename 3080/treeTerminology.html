		<h1>Tree Terminology</h1>
		<b>
			<font color="red">tree</font>
		</b> data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to
		navigate and search. It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has a hierarchical relationship
		between the nodes. <br><br>
		This data structure is a specialized method to organize and store data in the computer to be used more effectively.
		We can say that tree data structure has roots, branches, and leaves connected with one another.

		A tree is a special type of graph that: 
		<ul>
			<li>&clubs; <B><font color="blue">Is connected</font></B> (every node is reachable).</li>
			<li>&clubs; <B><font color="blue">Has no cycles</font></B> (no loops or repeated paths).</li>
			<li>&clubs; <B><font color="blue">Has a root</font></B> (in rooted trees) that starts the structure.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Root</h2>
		A special type of graph called a <b>tree</b> turns out to be a very useful representation of data. A <b>
			<font color="blue">tree</font>
		</b> is an acyclic, connected graph with one node designated as the <b>
			<font color="blue">root</font>
		</b> of the tree.
		<br>

		</center>

		Figure 6.31 pictures two trees. Perversely, computer scientists like to draw trees with the root at the top. An
		acyclic connected graph with no designated root node is called a nonrooted tree or a free tree. (Again, terminology
		is nonstandard. Some books define trees as acyclic, connected graphs and then call them "rooted trees" when there is
		a designated root node.)
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Children and Parent</h2>
		A tree can also be defined recursively. A single node is a tree (with that node as its root). If \(T_1, T_2, ... ,
		T_t \) are disjoint trees with roots \(r_1, r_2, ... , r_t\), the graph formed by attaching a new node r by a single
		arc to each of \(r_1, r_2, ... , r_t\), is a tree with root r. The nodes \(r_1, r_2 ... , r_t\) are <b>
			<font color="blue">children</font>
		</b> of r, and r is a <b>
			<font color="blue">parent</font>
		</b> of \(r_1, r_2, ... , r_t\). Figure 6.32 shows the final step in the recursive construction of the tree in
		Figure 6.31b. It is often helpful to process a tree structure by working with it recursively, treating the subtrees
		as smaller tree objects.

		<br>
		<h2>Depth of a node</h2>
		Because a tree is a connected graph, there is a path from the root to any other node in the tree; because the tree
		is acyclic, that path is unique. The <b>
			<font color="blue">depth of a node</font>
		</b> in a tree is the length of the path from the root to the node; the root itself has depth 0.
		<br>

		<h2>Depth (height) of the tree</h2>
		The <b>
			<font color="blue">depth (height) of the tree</font>
		</b> is the maximum depth of any node in the tree; in other words, it is the length of the longest path from the
		root to any node.
		<br>

		<h2>Leaf and internal nodes</h2>
		A node with no children is called a <b>
			<font color="blue">leaf</font>
		</b> of the tree; all non-leaves are <font color="blue"><b>internal nodes</font></b>.
		<br>

		<h2>Forest</h2>
		A <b>
			<font color="blue">forest</font>
		</b> is an acyclic graph (not necessarily connected); thus a forest is a disjoint collection of trees. Figures 6.31a
		and 6.31b together form a forest.
		<Br>

		<h2>Binary trees</h2>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">Binary trees</font>
		</b>, where each node has at most two children, are of particular interest. In a binary tree, each child of a node
		is designated as either the <b>
			<font color="blue">left child</font>
		</b> or the <font color="blue">right child</font></b>.
		Figure 6.33 shows a binary tree of height 4
		<br>

		</center>

		<h2>Full binary tree</h2>
		A <b>
			<font color="blue">full binary tree</font>
		</b> occurs when all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same depth.
		Figure 6.34 shows a full binary tree of height 3.
		<br>
		<center>
			<img width="300px" height="200px" src="images/b2.png">
		</center>

		<h2>Complete binary tree</h2>
		A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which <b><font color="red">all the levels are completely filled except the lowest level, which
		is filled from the left</font></b>. A complete binary tree is an almost full binary tree; the bottom level of the tree is
		filling from left to right but may not have its full complement of leaves.
		Figure 6.35 shows a complete binary tree of height 3.
		<b>(Note that while a tree is a graph, a complete tree is not a complete graph!)</b>

		<h3>Complete binary Tree Example</h3>

		The following is a complete binary tree. Since all the levels except the last level should be completely filled. The
		nodes are filled from the left.

		The following is not a complete binary tree. The nodes need to be filled from the left.

		<h2>Applications of Trees </h2>
		
		By using trees, a collection of records can be efficiently searched to locate a particular record or to
		determine that a record is not in the collection. Examples of such a search would be checking for a volume in a
		library, for a patient’s medical record in a hospital, or an individual’s credit record at the bank. We will
		also look at <b>binary tree search</b> in Section 6.3.

		The organization chart indicating who reports to whom in a large company or other enterprise is usually a tree.

			<font size="5" color="red">Example 3: Algebraic Expressions as Trees</font>
		</b>
		<br><br>
		In computer science and mathematics, algebraic expressions can be represented using binary trees, 
		known as <b><font color="blue">Expression Trees</font></b>. 
		These trees help in evaluating expressions, Symbolic Differentiation (Calculus), compiling code, and more.

		</b>
		<br>
			Data Compression: <a href="https://xinyangmtsu.github.io/3080/huffman.html" target="_blank">Huffman coding</a> is a popular technique for data compression that involves constructing a binary tree where the leaves represent characters and their frequency of occurrence. The resulting tree is used to encode the data in a way that minimizes the amount of storage required.
