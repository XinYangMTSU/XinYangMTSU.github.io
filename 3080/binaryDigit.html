  <h2>Bit</h2>
  A <b><font color="red">bit</font></b> is a binary digit, the smallest unit of data stored on a computer.
  A bit can hold only one of two values: 0 or 1, corresponding to the electrical values of off or on, respectively.

  <h2>Byte</h2>
  Because bits are so small, you rarely work with information one bit at a time. 
  Bits are usually assembled into a group of eight to form a byte. 
  A  <b><font color="red">byte</font></b> contains enough information to store a single ASCII character, like "A".
