		<h1>Computer Representation of Graphs</h1>
		We have said that the major advantage of a graph is its visual representation of information. What if we want to
		store a graph in digital form? Although it is possible to store a digital image of a graph, it takes a lot of space.
		Furthermore, such an image remains but a picture --- the data it represents can't be manipulated in any way. What we
		need to store these essential data that are part of the definition of a graph -- what the nodes are and which
		nodes have connecting arcs. From this information, a visual representation could be reconstructed if desired. The
		usual computer representations of a graph involve one of two data structures, either an adjacency matrix or an
		adjacency list.


		<h2>Adjacent Matrix</h2>
		
		An <b><font color="blue">adjacency matrix</font></b> is a <b><font color="blue">2D array</font></b> where rows and columns 
		represent <b><font color="blue">vertices (nodes)</font></b>, and each cell (i, j) indicates whether there is an edge between vertex i and vertex j.
		<br><br>

		An adjacency matrix is a <b>square matrix</b> used to represent a graph in mathematics and computer science. For a graph with
		\(n\) vertices, the adjacency matrix is an \(n \times n\) matrix where each element indicates whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not.
		<br><br>
		
		Suppose a graph as \(n\) nodes, numbered \(n_1,n_2,\dots,n_n\). This numbering imposes an arbitrary ordering on the
		set of nodes. Having ordered the nodes, we can form an \(n \times n\) matrix where entry \((i,j)\) is the number of
		arcs between nodes \(n_i\) and \(n_j\). This matrix is called the <b>
			<font color="blue">adjacency matrix A</font>
		</b> of the graph with respect to this ordering. Thus:
		$$
		a_{ij} = p, \text{where there are p arcs between } n_i \text{ and } n_j
		$$

		<br>
		Here’s how it works: <br><br>
		<ul>
			<li>If there is an edge between vertex i and vertex j, the matrix entry at position
			(i,j) will be 1 (or some positive value for weighted graphs).</li>
			<li>If there is no edge between vertex i and vertex j, the matrix entry at position
			(i,j) will be 0.</li>
		</ul>
			
		<b>
			<font color="blue">Example 1: Undirected Graph</font>
		</b>
		<hr>
		The adjacency matrix for the graph in Figure 1 with respect to the ordering 1,2,3,4,5,6 is a \(6 \times 6\) matrix.
		Entry (1,1) is a 1 due to the loop at the node. All other elements on the main diagnola are 0. Entry (2,1) (second
		row, first column) is a 1 because there is one arc between node 2 and node 1, which also means that entry (1,2) is a
		1.
		<br>
		$$
		\begin{pmatrix}
		1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
		1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
		1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
		\end{pmatrix}
		$$

		The adjacency matrix in Figure 1 is symmetric, which will be true for the adjacency matrix of any undirected graph
		-- if there are p arcs between \(n_i\) and \(n_j\), there are certainly p arcs between \(n_j\) and \(n_i\).They
		the symmetry of the matrix means that only elements on or below the main diagonal need to be stored. Therefore, all the
		information contained in the graph in Figure 1 is contained in the "lower triangular" array. 
		For <b><font color="blue">undirected graphs</font></b>, <b><font color="blue">the adjacency matrix is symmetric</font></b>.

		<b>
			<font color="blue">Example 2: Directed Graph</font>
		</b>
		<hr>
		An adjacency matrix for a directed graph will not necessarily be symmetric, because an arc from \(n_i\) to \(n_j\)
		does not imply an arc from \(n_j\) and \(n_i\). See the example in Figure 2:

		<b>
			<font color="blue">Example 3: Weighted Undirected Graph</font>
		</b>
		<hr>
		In a simple weighted graph, the entries in the adjacency matrix can indicate the weight of an arc by the appropriate
		number rather than just indicating the presence of an arc by the number 1.
