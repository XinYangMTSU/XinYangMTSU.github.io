		<h1>Computer Representation of Graphs</h1>
		We have said that the major advantange of a graph is its visual representation of information. What if we want to
		store a graph in digital form? Although it is possible to store a digital image of a graph, it takes a lot of sapce.
		Furthermore, such an image remains but a picture --- the data it represents can't be manipulated in any way. What we
		need to store are these essential data that are part of the definition of a graph -- what the nodes are and which
		nodes have connecting arcs. From this information a visual representation could be reconstructed if desired. The
		usual computer representations of a graph invovle one of two data structures, either an adjacency matrix or an
		adjacency list.


		<h2>Adjacent Matrix</h2>
		Suppose a graph as \(n\) nodes, numbered \(n_1,n_2,\dots,n_n\). This numbering imposes an arbitrary ordering on the
		set of nodes. Having ordered the nodes, we can form an \(n \times n\) matrix where entry \((i,j)\) is the number of
		arcs between nodes \(n_i\) and \(n_j\). This matrix is called the <b>
			<font color="blue">adjacency matrix A</font>
		</b> of the graph with respect to this ordering. Thus:
		$$
		a_{ij} = p, \text{where there are p arcs between } n_i \text{ and } n_j
		$$

		The adjacency matrix for the graph in Figure 1 with respect to the ordering 1,2,3,4,5,6 is a \(6 \times 6\) matrix.
		Entry (1,1) is a 1 due to the loop at the node. All other elements on the main diagnola are 0. Entry (2,1) (second
		row, first column) is a 1 because there is one arc between node 2 and node 1, which also means that entry (1,2) is a
		1.
		<br>
		$$
		\begin{pmatrix}
		1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
		1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
		1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
		\end{pmatrix}
		$$

		The adjacency matrix in Figure 1 is symmetric, which will be true for the adjacency matrix of any undirected graph
		-- if there are p arcs between \(n_i\) and \(n_j\), there are certainly p arcs between \(n_j\) and \(n_i\).They
		symmetry of the matrix means that only elements on or below the main diagnoal need to be stored. Therefore, all the
		information contained in the graph in Figure 1 is contained in the "lower triangular" array.
		<br>

		<hr>
		An adjacency matrix for a directed graph will not necessarily be symmetric, because an arc from \(n_i\) to \(n_j\)
		does not imply an arc from \(n_j\) and \(n_i\). See the example in Figure 2:

		<hr>
		In a simple weighted graph, the entries in the adjacency matrix can indicate the weight of an arc by the appropriate
		number rather than just indicating the presence of an arc by the number 1.
