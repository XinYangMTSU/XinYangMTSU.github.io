		<h1>Chapter 7: Graph Algorithms</h1>

			<h2>Section 7.4 Traversal Algorithms</h2>
		</center>

		<br>
		<br>

		In this section we deal with a simpler problem--we only want to write down all the nodes of a simple, connected
		graph G in some orderly way. This means we must find a path that visits each node at least once, but we can visit it
		more than once if we don't write it down again. We can also retrace arcs on the graph if necessary, and clearly this
		would in general be necessary if we were to visit each node in a tree. This process is called <b>
			<font color="blue">graph traversal</font>
		</b>. We already have several mechanisms for tree traversal (Section 6.2). The two algorithms in this section
		generalize traversal to apply to any simple, connected graph.


		<h2>Breadth-First Search</h2>
		In breadth-first search, beginning at an arbitrary node a, we first fan out from node a to visit nodes that are
		adjacent to a; then we fan out from those nodes, and so on, almost like the concentric circles of ripples in a pond.
		Figure 7.15 shows the first few nodes visited in the same graph as Figure 7.13, this time using breadth-first
		search.

		To write the breadth-first search algorithm in an elegant fashion, we will use a <b>
			<font color="blue">queue</font>
		</b> structure. A queue is simply a line in which new arrivals are added at the back and departures take place at
		the front

		<h2>Practice</h2>
		Please write the nodes in a breadth-first search of the graph in Figure 7.14.
