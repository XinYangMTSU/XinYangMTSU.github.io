		We noted that S = {\(0^n\)\(1^n\) | n &ge; 0} is not a regular set, Kleene's theorem tells us that it is not
		recognizable by any finite-state machine.
		<Br>
		<br>
		To simulate more general computational procedures than the finite-state machine can handle, we use a <b>
			<font color="blue">Turing machine</font>
		</b>, proposed by the British mathematician Alan M. Turing in 1936. Turing machine is essentially a finite-state
		machine with the added ability to reread its input and also to erase and write over its input. It also has unlimited
		auxiliary memory. Thus, the Turing machine overcomes the deficiencies we noted in finite-state machines. Unlimited
		auxiliary memory makes the Turing machine a hypothetical "machine" -- a model--not a real device.
		<br>
		<br>
		A <font color="blue"><b>Turing machine</b></font> is an abstract computational model that performs computations by
		reading and writing to an infinite
		tape. Turing machines are similar to finite automata/finite state machines but have the advantage of unlimited
		memory. They are capable of simulating common computers; a problem that a common computer can solve (given enough
		memory) will also be solvable using a Turing machine, and vice versa. Turing machines were invented by the esteemed
		computer scientist Alan Turing in 1936. <font color="blue"><b>It is a simple yet powerful abstract machine that
				serves as a fundamental
				concept in the field of theoretical computer science.</b></font>
		<br><br>
		The Turing machine was designed to <b>explore the limits of what is computable</b>.
		
		
		<h2>Turing Machine</h2>
		A Turing machine consists of a finite-state machine and an unlimited tape divided into cells, each cell containing
		at most one symbol from an allowable finite alphabet. At any one instant, only a finite number of cells on the tape
		are nonblank. We use the special symbol b to denote a blank cell. The finite-state unit, through its read-write
		head, reads one cell of the tape at any given moment (Figure 9.15).
		<br>
		<br>
		<center>

		</center>
		<br>
		By the next clock pulse, depending on the present state of the unit and the symbol read, the unit either does
		nothing (halts) or completes three actions:
		<br>
		<br>
		<font size=4 color="blue">
			1. Print a symbol from the alphabet on the cell read (it might be the same symbol that's already there). <Br>
			2. Go to the next state (it might be the same state as before) <Br>
			3. Move the read -- write head one cell left or right. <Br>
		</font>
		<Br>
		We can describe the actions of any particular Turing machine by a set of quintuples of the form <b>
			<font color="blue">(s,i,i',s',d)</font>
		</b>, where s and i indicate the present state and the tape symobl being read, i' denotes the symbol printed, s'
		denotes the new state, and d denotes the direction in which the read-write head moves (R for ight, L for left).
		<br>

		<br>
		the configuration illustrated in Figure 9.16b. The symbol 1 being read on the tape has been changed to a 0, the
		state of the unit has been changed from 2 to 1, and the head has moved one cell to the right.
		<Br>

		<h2>Definition</h2>

		<center>
			<img width="700px" height="150px" src="images/tm3.png">
		</center>
		<br>
		The restriction that no two quintuples begin with the same s and i symbols ensures that the action of the Turing
		machine is deterministic and completely specified by its present state and symbol read. <font color="red"><b>If a
				Turing machine gets
				into a configuration for which its present state and symbol read are not the first two symbols of any
				quintuple,
				the machine halts.</b></font>
		<Br>
		Just as in the case of ordinary finite-state machines, <font color="blue"><b>we specify a fixed starting state,
				denoted by 0</b></font>, in which
		the machine begins any computation. We also assume an initial configuration for the read-write
		head, namely, <font color="blue"><b>a
				position over the farthest left nonblank symbol on the tape.</b></font> (If the tape is initially all blank, the
		read-write
		head can be positioned anywhere to start.)

		The tape serves as a memory medium for a Turing machine, and in general, the machine can reread cells of the tape.
		Since it can also write on the tape, the nonblank portion of the tape can be as long as desired, although there are
		still only a finite number of nonblank cells at any time. Hence the machine has available an unbounded, though
		finite, amount of storage. Because Turing machines overcome the limitations of finite-state machines, Turing
		machines should have considerably higher capabilities. In fact, a finite-state machine is a very special case of a
		Turing machine, one that always prints the old symbol on the cell read, always moves to the right, and always halts
		on the symbol b.

		<h2>Why do we study Turing Machines? </h2>


		
			<h3>1. Defines Computability</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The Turing machine concept answers fundamental questions like 
					<b>"What problems can be solved by a computer?"</b> and <b>"What problems cannot be solved?"</b>
				</li>
				<li>Some problems are <b>undecidable</b>, meaning no algorithm (or program) can ever solve them. 
				Turing machines help us identify these boundaries, which is crucial in fields like artificial intelligence, 
				cryptography, and optimization.</li>
			</ul>
		
			<h3>2. Foundation of Algorithms and Complexity</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Concepts like <b>Big O notation</b> (for algorithm efficiency) and <b>P vs NP problems</b> (for understanding complex problems) are built on ideas from Turing machines.</li>
				<li>Turing machines give us a <b>basic model of computation</b> that all computers can follow. Any algorithm you write, no matter how complex, can theoretically be executed on a Turing machine.</li>
			</ul>
			

		Turing machines can solve a wide range of problems, here are the main types of problems that can be solved by a Turing machine:
		<br>
		
		<h3>1. Decidable Problems</h3>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Arithmetic calculations:</b> Any standard arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) can be solved.</li>
		<li><b>Sorting and searching:</b> Sorting a list of numbers, finding an item in a sorted list, and similar tasks are solvable by an algorithm.</li>
		<li><b>Graph traversal:</b> Problems like finding the shortest path in a graph (Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm) or determining if two nodes are connected.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>2. Optimization Problems (within bounds)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Shortest path problems:</b> Finding the shortest route in a network.
</li>
			<li><b>Scheduling problems:</b> Optimizing tasks over time given certain constraints (e.g., job scheduling in processors).</li>
		</ul>

		<br>
		Problems that Are Not Solvable by a Turing Machine:
		<b>1. Unsolvable or Undecidable Problems</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>The Halting Problem:</b> Determining whether any given program will halt or run forever.</li>
		</ul>

		We study Turing Machines because they provide a theoretical framework for understanding the nature of computation
		and the limits of what can be computed. They were first described by Alan Turing in 1936, and they have become a
		fundamental concept in the field of theoretical computer science. They are used to model the behavior of algorithms
		and to analyze the computability of different problems. Additionally, they serve as a foundation for the theory of
		complexity, which is used to study the efficiency of algorithms and the resources required to solve different
		problems. Overall, studying Turing Machines helps us understand the capabilities and limitations of computers and
		computation. <br><br>The power of Turing Machines lies in their ability to simulate any algorithm or computation
		that can be
		performed by a computer. They can solve problems that are algorithmically solvable and describe the limits of what
		can be computed.

		Turing's explanation of his machine was primarily intended as a theoretical construct rather than a practical
		blueprint for physical implementation. When Alan Turing introduced the concept of the Turing Machine in his seminal
		1936 paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem," his goal was to define a
		mathematical model that captured the essence of computation. <br><br>
		In reality, physical computers and programming languages are built upon various technologies and architectures that
		differ from the abstract model of a Turing Machine. However, Turing Machines have had a profound impact on the
		development of computer science and the understanding of computation. They serve as a theoretical foundation for
		studying the limits of computation, complexity theory, and the theoretical aspects of algorithms. <br><br>
		It's important to note that although Turing Machines may not be directly implemented in physical form, their
		concepts and principles
		have influenced the design and development of real-world computers and programming languages. Turing's work laid the
		groundwork for the development of modern computing and provided invaluable insights into the theoretical
		underpinnings of computation.
