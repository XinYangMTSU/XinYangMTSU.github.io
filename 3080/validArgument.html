		<h1>Propositional Logic</h1>

		<h2>Propositional Logic</h2>
		In Section 1.1, we used the notation of formal logic to represent statements in symbolic form as wffs;
		because statements are sometimes called <b>
			<font color="blue">propositions</font>
		</b>,
		these wffs are also called <b>
			<font color="blue">propositional wffs</font>
		</b>.
		<br>
		<br>
		Now we want to use tools from formal logic to see how to reach logical conclusion based on
		given statements. The formal system that uses propositional wffs is called
		<b>
			<font color="blue">propositional logic, statement logic</font>
		</b>.

		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Propositional Logic as a Tool for argument representation: </b> <br>
		This branch of formal logic deals with propositions (or statements) and 
		their relationships. It uses symbols to represent logical operators (like AND, OR, NOT, etc.) 
		and propositions, allowing complex arguments to be expressed in a precise and unambiguous way.
		<br><br>
		<b>Well-Formed Formulas (wffs):</b><br> 
		These are expressions in propositional logic that are syntactically correct. 
		Arguments are constructed using these wffs, where each wff 
		represents a proposition or a logical combination of propositions.
		
		
		<br>

		<h2>Valid Arguments</h2>
		In propositional logic, an argument consists of premises (assumptions) and a conclusion. 
		These are all expressed as wffs. Propositional logic allows arguments to be written in symbolic form, 
		making the logical structure of the argument clear.
		<br><br>
		An argument can be represented in symbolic form as: <br>
		<Br>
		<center>
			\( P_1 &and; P_2 &and; P_3 &and; ... &and; P_n &rarr; Q \)
		</center>
		<br>
		where \(P_1, P_2, ..., P_n\) are the given statements, called the <b>
			<font color="blue">hypotheses</font>
		</b>, of the argument, and \(Q\) is the <b>
			<font color="blue">conclusion</font>
		</b>
		of the argument. As usual, the \(P's\) and the \(Q\) represent wffs, not merely statement letters. When should this
		be considered a valid argument?

		<h3>Definition:</h3>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">
				The propositional wff: <br>
				<br>
				<center>
					\( P_1 &and; P_2 &and; P_3 &and; ... &and; P_n &rarr; Q \)
				</center>
				<br>
				is a valid argument when it is a tautology.

		</b>


		<h2>Example</h2>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">&bull; Example 1:</font>
		</b> <br>
		<br>
		George Washington was the first president of the United States.
		Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence.
		Therefore, every day has 24 hours. <br>
		<br>
		This argument has two hypotheses: <br>
		A: George Washington was the first president of the United States. <br>
		B: Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. <br>
		<br>
		and the conclusion: <br>
		C: Every day has 24 hours. <br>
		<br>
		The argument would be symbolized as: <br>
		<center>
			\( A &and; B &rarr; C\)
		</center>
		<br>
		Even though each of the individual hypotheses, as well as the conclusion, is a true statement, we would not consider
		this argument valid, since it is NOT a tautology.

			<font color="blue">&bull; Example 2:</font>
		</b>
		<br>
		<Br>
		If George Washington was the first president of the United States,
		then John Adams was the first vice president. George Washington was
		the first president of the United States. Therefore John Adams was
		the first vice president.
		<Br>
		<Br>
		This argument has the two hypotheses: <Br>
		\(A &rarr; B\): If George Washington was the first president of the United States, then John Adams was the first
		vice president. <Br>
		\(A\): George Washington was the first president of the United States.
		<br>
		<br>
		and the conclusion: <br>
		\(B\): John Adams was the first vice president.
		<Br>
		<br>
		The argument would be symbolized as: <Br>
		<center>
			\((A &rarr; B) &and; A &rarr; B\)
		</center>
		<Br>
		The truth table establishes that this argument is a tautology. The argument is valid; its from is such that
		conculsion follows inevitably from the hypotheses.
		<Br>
		<br>
		<center>
			<table style="width:80%">
				<tr>
					<th>\(A\)</th>
					<th>\(B\)</th>
					<th>\(A &rarr; B\)</th>
					<th>\( (A &rarr; B) &and; A \)</th>

		To test whether a wff \(P_1 &and; P_2 &and; P_3 &and; ... &and; P_n &rarr; Q\)
		is a tautology, we could build a truth table or use algorithm TautologTest. Instead, we will trun to formal logic,
		which uses a system of <b>derivation rules</b> that manuipulate wffs in a truth preserving manner. You begin with
		the hypotheses \(P_1, ..., P_n\) (assumed true) and attempt to apply the manipulation rules in such a way as to end
		up with the conclusion \(Q\).
		<br>
		<h2>Proof Sequence</h2>
		<font color="blue">
			A <b>proof sequence</b> is a sequence of wffs in which each wff is either a hypothesis or the result of applying
			one of the formal system's derivation rules to earlier wffs in the sequence.
		</font>
		<br>
		<br>
		Using formal logic to prove that \(Q\) is a valid conclusion from \(P_1, ..., P_n\), we must produce a proof
		sequence of the form: <br>
		<br>

		\(P_1\) &nbsp; &nbsp; (hypothesis) <br>
		\(P_2\) &nbsp; &nbsp; (hypothesis) <br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . <Br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . <br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . <Br>
		\(P_n\) &nbsp; &nbsp; (hypothesis) <br>
		\(wff_1\) &nbsp; &nbsp; (obtained by applying a derivation rule to earlier wffs.) <br>
		\(wff_2\) &nbsp; &nbsp; (obtained by applying a derivation rule to earlier wffs.) <Br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . <Br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . <br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . <Br>
		\(Q\) &nbsp; &nbsp; (obtained by applying a derivation rule to earlier wffs.) <Br>
