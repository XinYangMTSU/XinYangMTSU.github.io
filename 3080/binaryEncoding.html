		<h1>Binary Encoding</h1>

		Although the binary number system has many practical advantages and is widely used in digital computers, in many
		cases it is convenient to work with the decimal number system, especially when the communication between man
		and the machine is extensive since most numerical data generated by man are in terms of decimal numbers. To simplify
		the communication problem between man and machine, a number of codes have been devised so that the decimal
		digits are represented by sequences of binary digits.

		<h2>Weighted Codes</h2>
		Weighted binary codes are those binary codes that obey the positional weight principle. Each position of the number
		represents a specific weight. 
		<br><br>
		The weighted code is characterized by assigning a specific weight to each binary digit (bit). 
		The decimal value represented by the code is equal to the sum of each bit's weight multiplied by the binary digit (1 or 0) at that position. 
		This sum corresponds directly to the decimal digit being represented.

		represented by 11011011.

		<b><font color="blue">Hexadecimal</font></b>, often abbreviated as <b><font color="blue">hex</font></b>, is a base-16 numeral system. 
		It uses 16 symbols to represent numbers: 
		<ul>
			<li>The digits <b>0</b> to <b>9</b> represent values 0 to 9.</li>
			<li>The letters <b>A</b> to <b>F</b> represent values 10 to 15.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		Hexadecimal is widely used in computer systems because it is more compact and human-readable than binary (base-2):
		<ul>
			<li>One <b>hexadecimal digit</b> represents <b>4 binary bits</b> (a nibble).</li>	
			<li>For example:</li>
			<pre>
				Binary: 1111 1111
				Hexadecimal: FF
			</pre>
		</ul>
		<b><font color="blue">Example Conversions:</font></b>
		<ul>
			<li>1. <b>Binary to Hexadecimal:</b></li>
			<pre>
			Binary 110101101011 --> Group into nibbles: 1101 0110 1011 --> Hex: D6B
			</pre>
			<li>2. <b>Decimal to Hexadecimal:</b></li>
			<pre>
			Let’s convert the decimal number 756 to hexadecimal.
			1. 756 ÷ 16 = 47 remainder 4
				Record 4 (this will be the last digit of the hex number).
			2. 47 ÷ 16 = 2 remainder 15
				Record 15. Since 15 in hexadecimal is F, we write F.
			3. 2 ÷ 16 = 0 remainder 2
				Record 2 (this is the last step as the quotient is now 0).
			4. Read from Bottom to Top:
				The hexadecimal number for decimal 756 is 2F4.

		Hexadecimal is extensively used in programming, memory addressing, and color codes in web design (e.g., #FF5733).

			<font color="red">BCD(binary-coded-decimal) Code</font>
		</h3>
		<hr>
		
		To represent the 10 decimal digits (0, 1, ..., 9) in binary, <b><font color="red">at least 4 binary digits (bits)</font></b> are required.
		<br><br>
		 If \( w_1, w_2, w_3,\) and \(w_4\) are the weights of the binary digits 
		and \(x_1, x_2, x_3, \) and \(x_4\) are the corresponding digit values, 
		then the decimal digit \(D = w_4 \times x_4 + w_3 \times x_3 + w_2 \times x_2 + w_1 \times x_1 \)
		is represented by the binary sequence \(x_4x_3x_2x_1\). A sequence of binary digits which represents a
decimal digit is called a <b><font color="blue">code word</font></b>. Thus the above sequence \(x_4x_3x_2x_1\) is the code word for \(D\).
		<br><br>
		The binary digits in the first code in the following table are assigned the weights 8, 4, 2, 1. As a result of this
		weight
		assignment, the code word that corresponds to each decimal digit is the binary equivalence of that digit; e.g., 5 is
		represented by 0101, and so on. This code is known as the <b>
			<font color="blue">BCD (binary-coded-decimal)</font>
		</b> code. This scheme can also be referred to as Simple Binary-Coded Decimal (SBCD) or BCD 8421. In this code each
		decimal digit is represented by a 4-bit binary number. BCD is a way to express each of the decimal digits with a
		binary code. In the BCD, with four bits we can represent sixteen numbers (0000 to 1111). But in BCD code only first
		ten of these are used (0000 to 1001). The remaining six code combinations i.e. 1010 to 1111 are invalid in BCD.
		For each of the codes
		in the table, the decimal digit that corresponds to a given code word is equal to the sum of the weights in those
		binary positions which are 1s. <br>

			<font color="red">Self-Complementing Code</font>
		</h3>
		<hr>
		<br>
		A <b><font color="blue">self-complementing code</font></b> is one where flipping each bit in the binary code of a digit gives the binary code of its 9’s complement.
		<br><br>
		In a self-complementing code, the binary representation of a decimal digit <b>D</b> (such as 0 through 9)
		has a special property: if you <b>invert (flip) each bit</b> of that code, you get the binary representation
		 of \(9-D\) ( which is known as the "<b>9's complement</b>" of D).
		<br><br>
		A necessary condition for a code to be <b>self-complementing</b> is that <b>the sum of the weights</b> must equal <b>9</b>.

It is apparent that the representations of some decimal numbers in the (2,4,2,1) and (6,4,2,-3) codes are not unique.
For example, in the (2,4,2,1) code, decimal 7 may be represented by 1101 as well as by 0111. 			
<br><br>
There exist only four positively weighted self-complementing codes, name, (2,4,2,1), (3,3,2,1), (4,3,1,1), (5,2,1,1).
<br>
	In addition, there exist 13 self-complementing codes with positive and negative weights.		
	<br><br>
			
		<b><font color="blue">Why This Is Useful</font></b>
		<ul>
			<li>You can find the 9's complement of any digit by simply flipping the bits in its code.</li>
			<li>This makes arithmetic operations, especially subtraction, easier to implement in digital circuits, as no extra calculations are needed to find complements.
</li>

		<h2>Nonweighted Codes</h2>
		In this type of binary code, the positional weights are not assigned. The examples of non-weighted codes are
		Excess-3 code and Gray code.

		<h3>
			<font color="red">Excess-3 code</font>
		</h3>
		The Excess-3 code is also called as XS-3 code. It is a non-weighted code used to express decimal numbers. The Excess-3
		code words are derived from the 8421 BCD code words adding \( (0011)_2 \)or \( (3)_{10} \) to each code word in
		8421. The excess-3 codes are obtained as follows :

			<img width="600px" height="400px" src="images/excess-3Table.png">
		</center>

		<br>
		<h3>Excess-3 code Application</h3>
		Error detection: Excess-3 code helps in error detection. In some cases, errors can occur during data transmission or
		processing and it's important to identify and correct these errors. Excess-3 code has the property that adjacent
		numbers have a Hamming distance of at least two. This means that if a single-bit error occurs in the code, it will
		result in an invalid excess-3 code, indicating that an error has occurred. This error detection capability is
		beneficial in ensuring data integrity.
		<br>

		<h3>
			<h3>
				<font color="red">Gray Code</font>
			</h3>
			It is a non-weighted code and it is not an arithmetic code. That means there are no specific weights assigned to
			the bit position. It has a very special feature that, only one bit will change each time the decimal number is
			incremented as shown in Fig. As only one-bit changes at a time, the gray code is called as a unit distance code.
			The gray code is a <b>
				<font color="blue">cyclic code</font>
			</b>. Gray code cannot be used for arithmetic operations.
			In this code, two consecutive values are differed by one bit of binary digits.
