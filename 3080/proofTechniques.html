			<h2>Section 2.1 Proof Techniques</h2>

		<br>
		<br>

		<h1>2.1 Proof Techniques</h1>
		The formal argument of Chapter 1 have the form \(P &rarr; Q\), where \(P\) and \(Q\) may present compound
		statements. The point there was to prove that an argument is valid -- true in all interpretations by nature of its
		internal form or structures, not because of its content or the meaning of its component parts. <Br>

		<b><font color="red">However, we often want to prove arguments that are not universally true but just true within some context.</font></b> Meaning
		becomes important because we are discussing a particular subject -- graph algorithms, or Boolean algebra, or
		compiler theory, or whatever and we want to prove that if \(P\) is true in this context, then so is \(Q\).
		<Br>
		<b><font color="red">If we can do this, then \(P &rarr; Q\) becomes a <b>theorem</b> about that subject.</font></b>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b><font color="blue">Proposition</font></b> is a statement that can be either true or false. <br>
		<b><font color="blue">Theorem</font></b> is a proposition that has passed the mathematical verification process and it proved to be True.
		<br>


		<h2>To Prove or Disprove</h2>
		If you are simply presented with a conjecture, it may be difficult to decide which of the two approaches you should
		try -- to prove the conjecture or to disprove it! A simple counterexample to a conjecture is sufficient to disprove
		it. Of course, merely hunting for a counterexample and being unsuccessful does not constitute a proof that the
		conjecture is true.
		<br>


		<h2>Disprove</h2>
		One <b>
			<font color="red">counterexample</font>
		</b> is enough to disprove a conjecture.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">Example 1:</font>
		</b> <br>
		<hr>
		
For a positive integer \( n \), \( n \) factorial is defined as \( n*(n-1)*(n-2)...1 \), and is denoted by \( n! \). Prove
or disprove the conjecture: "For every positive integer \( n \),   \( n! <= n^2 \)"
<br><br>
Let's begin by testing some cases:	     
		<br>
		<center>
			<table style="width:50%">
				<tr>
					<th>\(n\)</th>
					<th>\(n!\)</th>
					<th>\(n^2\)</th>
					<th>\(n! <= n^2\)</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>1</th>
					<th>1</th>
					<th>1</th>
					<th>yes</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>2</th>
					<th>2</th>
					<th>4</th>
					<th>yes</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>3</th>
					<th>6</th>
					<th>9</th>
					<th>yes</th>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</center>
		<br>
		<pre>
So far, this conjecture seems to be looking good. But for the next case,
</pre>
		<center>
			<table style="width:50%">
				<tr>
					<th>\(n\)</th>
					<th>\(n!\)</th>
					<th>\(n^2\)</th>
					<th>\(n! <= n^2\)</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<th>4</th>
					<th>24</th>
					<th>16</th>
					<th>no</th>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</center>
		<pre>
We have found a counterexample. The fact that the conjecture is true for n = 1,2, and 3
does nothing to prove the conjecture, but the singe case n = 4 is enough to disprove it.
</pre>
		If a counterexample is not forthcoming, perhaps the conjecture is true and we should try to
		prove it. What techniques can we use to try to do this? For the rest of this section, we'll
		examine various methods of attacking a proof.

		<br>
		<h2>Exhaustive Proof</h2>
		While "disproof by counterexample" always works, "proof by example" seldom does. The one exception
		to this situation occurs when the conjecture is an assertion about a finite collection. In this case,
		the conjecture can be proved true by showing that it is true for each member of the collection.
		<b>
			<font color="red">Proof by exhaustion</font>
		</b> means that all possible cases have been exhausted, although it often means that the person doing the proof is
		exhausted as well!
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">Example 2:</font>
		</b> <br>
		<hr>
		<pre>
Prove the conjecture, "If an integer between 1 and 20 is divisible by 6, then it is 
also divisible by 3" ("Divisible by 6" means, "evenly divisible by 6," that is, 
the number is an integral multiple of 6.)

Because there is only a finite number of cases, the conjecture can be proved by 
simply showing it to be true for all the integers between 1 and 20. Table 2 is the proof.

		<h2>Direct Proof</h2>
		In general (where exhaustive proof won't work), how can you prove that \(P &rarr; Q\) is true? The obvious approach
		is the <b>
			<font color="red">direct proof</font>
		</b>--assume the hypothesis \(P\) and deduce the conclusion \(Q\). The following example shows an informal proof
		that if two numbers are even (that's the hypothesis \(P\)), then their product is even (that's the conclusion
		\(Q\)). Recall that an <b>even number</b> is a number that is an integral multiple of 2, for example, 18 is even
		because 18 = 2*9. An <b>odd number</b> is 1 more than an integral multiple of 2, for example, 19 = 2*9 +1.
		<br>
		<br>
	
		A <b><font color="red">direct proof</font></b> is a method of mathematical reasoning where you demonstrate the truth of a proposition by a 
		straightforward chain of logical deductions from known facts, definitions, or previously 
		established theorems. In direct proof, you assume the hypothesis or premises are true and 
		use logical steps to arrive at the conclusion.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">Example 3:</font>
		</b> <br>
		<hr>
		<pre>
Consider the conjecture
   
     x is an even integer and y is an even integer -> the product x*y is an even integer.

Rewrite as P->Q: Prove that if x and y are even, then x*y is even.

The proof sequence might look like the following:

1. x is even         (hypothesis)
2. y is even         (hypothesis)
3. x = 2m            (definition of even)
4. y = 2n            (definition of even)
5. x*y = (2m)*(2n)   (substitution)
6. x*y = 2*(m*2*n)   (algebra)
7. x*y is even       (definition of even)
</pre>

<b>Hint:</b> 
	<br>
	The definition of an even integer is any integer that is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. <br>
	An odd integer is any integer that is not divisible by 2.
<br>
	
		<h2>Proof by Contraposition</h2>
		If you have tried diligently but failed to produce a direct proof of your conjecture \(P &rarr; Q\), and you still
		feel that the conjecture is true, you might try some variants on the direct proof technique. If you can prove the
		theorem \(Q' &rarr; P'\), you can conclude \(P &rarr; Q\) by making use of the tautology \( (Q' &rarr; P') &rarr; (P
		&rarr; Q) \). \(Q' &rarr; P'\) is the <b>contrapositive</b> of \(P &rarr; Q\), and the technique of proving \(P
		&rarr; Q\) by doing a direct proof of \(Q' &rarr; P'\) is called <b>
			<font color="blue">proof by contraposition</font>
		</b>.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>
			<font color="blue">Example 4:</font>
		</b> <Br>
		<hr>
		<pre>
Prove that if the square of an integer is odd, then the integer must be odd.

Rewrite the conjecture as P->Q:  If n^2 is odd, then n is odd.
		</pre>
			
  <table style="width:50%">
    <tr>
      <th>P: \( n^2 \) is odd </th>
      <th>Q: n is odd</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>P': \( n^2 \) is even</th>
      <th>Q': n is even</th>
    </tr>
  </table>

<pre>
Write the Contrapositive Q'->P': If an integer is even, then the square of the integer is even.

Rewrite the contrapositive: If x is even, then x^2 is even.

Direct proof of the contrapositive:

1. x is even          (hypothesis)
2. x = 2*m            (definition of even)
3. x^2 = 2m*2m        (substitution)
4. x^2 = 2*(m*2*m)    (algebra)
5. x^2 is even        (definition of even)
</pre>

<b>Conclusion:</b><br>
Since we have proven the contrapositive statement, the original statement is also true by logic. 
Therefore, <b>if the square of an integer is odd, the integer itself must be odd.</b>

		<h2>Proof by Contradiction</h2>
		In addition to direct proof and proof by contraposition, you might use the technique of <b>
			<font color="blue">proof by contradiction</font>
		</b>. (Proof by contradiction is sometimes called <b>indirect proof</b>, but this term more properly means any
		argument that is not a direct proof.) <br>
		Suppose you are trying to prove \(P &rarr; Q\). By constructing a truth table, we see that <Br>
		<Br>
		<center>
			\((P &and; Q' &rarr; 0) &rarr; (P &rarr; Q)\)
		</center>
		is a tautology, so to prove the theorem \(P &rarr; Q\), it is sufficient to prove \(P &and; Q' &rarr; 0\).
		<Br>
	<br>
	<table style="width:80%">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th>P</th>
      <th>Q</th>
      <th>Q'</th>
      <th>\( P &and; Q' \)</th>
      <th>\(P &and; Q' &rarr; 0 \)</th>
      <th>\(P &rarr; Q \)</th>
      <th>\( (P &and; Q' &rarr;  0) &rarr; (P &rarr; Q) \)</th>
    </tr>

		Therefore, in a proof by contradiction, you assume that both the hypothesis and the negation of the conclusion are
		true and then try to deduce some contradiction from these assumptions.
		<Br>
		<br>
		It is hard to prove that something is not true; it's much easier to assume it is true and obtain a contradiction.
		<br>
		<br>

Let's use proof by contradiction on the statement: "If a number added to itself gives itself, 
then the number is 0." 

    <table style="width:50%">
    <tr>
      <th>P: x + x = x </th>
      <th>Q: x = 0</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th>Q': x != 0</th>
    </tr>
  </table>
  
Let x represent any number.  
Rewrite the conjecture as P &rarr; Q: If x + x = x, then x = 0.

Indirect proof by contradiction (P &and; Q' &rarr; 0):

1. x + x = x        (hypothesis)
2. x != 0           (hypothesis)
3. 2x = x           (algebra, because x != 0, we can divide both sides of the equation by x)
4. 2 = 1            (contradiction)
</pre>
		Hence, \( (x + x = x ) &rarr; (x = 0) \)
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Reminder: </b>To prove that something is not true, try proof by contradiction.

		<h2>Serendipity</h2>
		Serendipity means a fortuitous happening, or good luck. While this isn't really a
		general proof technique, some of the most interesting proofs come from clever observations that we can admire, even
		if we would never have thought of them ourselves. We'll look at such proofs, just for fun.
		<br>
		<pre>
<b><font color="blue">Example 6: </font></b>
<hr>
A tennis tournament has 342 players. A single match involves 2 players. 
The winner of a match plays the winner of a match in the next round, 
while losers are eliminated from the tournament. The 2 players who have 
won all previous rounds play in the final game, and the winner wins the tournament. 
Prove that the total number of matches to be played is 341.

The hard way to prove this result is to compute 342/2 = 171 to get the number of 
matches in the first round, resulting in 171 winners to go on to the second round. 
For the second round, 171/2=85 plus 1 left over; there are 85 matches and 85 winners, 
plus the 1 left over, to go on to the third round. The third round had 86/2=43 matches, 
and so forth. The total number of matches is the sum of 171 + 85 + 43 + ... 

The clever observation is to note that each match results in exactly 1 loser, 
so there must be the same number of matches as losers in the tournament. 
Because there is only 1 winner, there are 341 losers and therefore 341 matches.
