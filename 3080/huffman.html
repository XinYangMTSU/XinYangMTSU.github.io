		<h1>Huffman Codes</h1>
		<br>
		Character data consist of letters of the alphabet (both uppercase and lowercase), punctuation symbols, and other
		keyboard symbols such as @ and %. Computers store character data in binary form, as a sequence of 0s and 1s, usually
		by fixing some length n so that \(2^n\) is at least as large as the number of distinct characters and then encoding
		each distinct character as a particular sequence of n bits. Each character must be encoded into its fixed binary
		sequence for electronic storage, and then the binary sequence must be decoded when the character is to be displayed.
		The most common encoding scheme for many years was ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), which
		uses n = 8, so that each character requires 8 bits to store. However, \(2^8 = 256\), so a maximum of 256 characters
		could be encoded. This was enough for the English alphabet, punctuation, and special characters, but as electronic
		data storage spread around the world, it was not enough to include characters found in other languages such as
		Russian, Japanese, Arabic, Greek, and many others. Unicode (in general) uses 16 bits to encode a single character,
		so that \(2^{16} = 65536\) character encodings are now available. But whatever value is chosen for n, each character
		requires the same amount of storage space.
		<br>
		<br>
		Suppose a collection of character data to be stored in a file in binary form is large enough that the amount of
		storage required is a consideration. Suppose also that the file is archival in nature, and its contents will not
		often be changed. Then it may be worthwhile to invest some extra effort in the encoding process if the amount of
		storage space required for the file could be reduced.
		<br>
		<br>

		Rather than using a fixed number of bits per character, an encoding scheme could use a variable number of bits and
		store frequently occurring characters as sequences with fewer bits. To store all the distinct characters, some
		sequences will still have to be long, but if the longer sequences are used for characters that occur less
		frequently, the overall storage required should be reduced. This approach requires knowledge of the particular file
		contents, which is why it is best suited for a file whose contents will not be frequently changed. We will study
		such a <b>
			<font color="blue">data compression</font>
		</b> or <b>
			<font color="blue">data compaction</font>
		</b> scheme here, because it is best described as a series of actions taken on binary trees. Huffman codes are a
		basic technique for doing data compression.

		In the fixed-length storage scheme with n bits for each character, the long string of bits within the encoded file
		can be broken up into the code for successive characters by simply looking at n bits at a time. This makes it easy
		to decode the file. In the variable-length code, there must be a way to tell when the sequence for one character
		ends and the sequence for another character begins.

		In Practice 28 the strings can be broken into the representation of characters in only one way. As each new digit is
		considered, the possibilities are narrowed as to which character is being represented until the character is
		uniquely identified by the end of that character's representation. There is never any need to guess at what the
		character might be and then backtrack if our guess proves wrong. This ability to decode uniquely without false
		starts and backtracking comes about because the code is an example of a <b>
			<font color="blue">prefix code</font>
		</b>. In a prefix code, the code for any character is never the prefix of the code for any other character. (A
		prefix code is therefore an "antiprefix" code!)

		<h2>Huffman Encoding Algorithm</h2>
		In our approach to prefix codes, we will build binary trees with the characters as leaves. Once the tree is built, a
		binary code can be assigned to each character by simply tracing the path from the root to that leaf, using <b>
			<font color="red">0 for a
				left branch</font>
		</b> and <b>
			<font color="red">1 for a right branch</font>
		</b>. Because no leaf precedes any other leaf on some path from the root, the code
		will be a prefix code.

				<b>Steps to create the huffman tree:</b>
			</font>
			<br>
			<hr>
			1. Create tree nodes containing the character and the frequenceis. <br>
			2. Sort based on frequencey-ascending <br>
			3. Take first two nodes in the list and create a parent node with the first
			node as the left child and the second node as the right child.
			The parent frequency is the sum of the two children frequencies.
			The children are removed from the list and parent is left in the list.
			<br>
			4. repeat steps 2 and 3 until there is only one node in the list.

		Once the tree is built, a binary code can be assigned to each character by simply tracing the path from the root to

		Using the above code, we can decode: <br>
