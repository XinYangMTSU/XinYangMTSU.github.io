        <h3>üå± Early Life</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Ludwig van Beethoven</b> (1770‚Äì1827) was a German composer and pianist, widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential musicians in Western classical music.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was born on <b>December 16, 1770</b>, in <b>Bonn, Germany</b>, into a musical family.
        </p>
        <p>
          His grandfather, also named <b>Ludwig van Beethoven</b>, was a respected <b>Kapellmeister (music director)</b> in Bonn and a great inspiration for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          His father, <b>Johann van Beethoven</b>, was a <b>tenor singer</b> and music teacher, but he struggled with alcoholism and became abusive, especially in pushing Ludwig‚Äôs early musical training.
        </p>
        <p>
          His mother, <b>Maria Magdalena Keverich</b>, was a gentle, kind-hearted woman whom Beethoven loved deeply. She was described as soft, caring, and a source of warmth in his difficult childhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beethoven's mother died of tuberculosis when he was only <b>17 years old</b> (in <b>1787</b>), a devastating emotional loss that deeply affected him.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a young age, Beethoven showed extraordinary musical talent. Recognized as a child prodigy, he performed in public concerts and worked as an assistant court organist by his early teens.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <b>1792</b>, at age 21, he moved to <b>Vienna</b> ‚Äî Europe's music capital ‚Äî to study with <b>Joseph Haydn</b> and soon gained fame as a brilliant pianist and an original, bold composer.
        </p>

    <div class="intro-card">
      <h3>üí™ Overcoming Challenges</h3>
       <p>
    Beethoven faced one of the most unimaginable obstacles for a musician: he began losing his hearing in his late twenties. At first, it started as a soft buzzing and ringing, but over time it worsened into profound deafness.
  </p>
  <p>
    By his early forties, Beethoven was almost completely unable to hear. This led him into periods of deep depression and isolation ‚Äî in 1802, he poured his despair into the famous <strong>Heiligenstadt Testament</strong>, a heartbreaking letter to his brothers, expressing his struggles and his resolve to continue living for the sake of his art.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite his suffering, Beethoven's spirit refused to break. Remarkably, he composed some of his most iconic masterpieces ‚Äî including the <strong>Fifth Symphony</strong>, <strong>Moonlight Sonata</strong>, and the <strong>Ninth Symphony</strong> ‚Äî after his hearing was severely impaired.
  </p>
  <p>
    His music became even more profound, filled with bold innovation, emotional intensity, and heroic spirit. Beethoven‚Äôs resilience transformed personal tragedy into timeless triumph, bridging the Classical tradition of Mozart and Haydn with the new passion and freedom of the Romantic era.
  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="intro-card">
      <h3>üåü Legacy</h3>
      <p>
    Beethoven's music reshaped the history of classical music forever. His masterpieces ‚Äî including the powerful <strong>Fifth Symphony</strong>, the soul-stirring <strong>Ninth Symphony ("Ode to Joy")</strong>, the dreamy <strong>Moonlight Sonata</strong>, the dramatic <strong>Path√©tique Sonata</strong>, and the beloved <strong>F√ºr Elise</strong> ‚Äî continue to inspire millions around the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    More than just beautiful sounds, Beethoven‚Äôs compositions embody deep emotional journeys: struggle, hope, resilience, and triumph. His work broke free from the strict rules of the Classical era and opened the doors to the expressive freedom of the Romantic era, influencing generations of composers like Schubert, Brahms, and Wagner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite personal hardships ‚Äî loneliness, deafness, illness ‚Äî Beethoven never gave up his artistic vision. His unshakable spirit, courage, and belief in the power of music to express the full range of human experience remain timeless.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, Beethoven is celebrated not only as one of the greatest composers of all time, but also as a symbol of perseverance, innovation, and the enduring strength of the human soul. His music reminds us that through art, we can transcend even our deepest struggles and reach for something greater. ‚ú®üé∂
